TI  - Ataxia-telangiectasia: mild neurological presentation despite null ATM mutation and 
      severe cellular phenotype.
PG  - 1827-34
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      progressive neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, susceptibility to cancer, genomic 
      instability, and sensitivity to ionizing radiation. A-T is caused by mutations that 
      eliminate or inactivate the nuclear protein kinase ATM, the chief activator of the 
      cellular response to double strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA. Mild A-T is usually 
      caused by ATM mutations that leave residual amounts of active ATM. We studied two 
      siblings with mild A-T, as defined by clinical examination and a quantitative A-T 
      neurological index. Surprisingly, no ATM was detected in the patients' cells, and 
      sequence analysis revealed that they were homozygous for a truncating ATM mutation 
      (5653delA) that is expected to lead to the classical, severe neurological 
      presentation. Moreover, the cellular phenotype of these patients was 
      indistinguishable from that of classical A-T: all the tested parameters of the DSB 
      response were severely defective as in typical A-T. This analysis shows that the 
      severity of the neurological component of A-T is determined not only by ATM 
      mutations but also by other influences yet to be found.

TI  - Genotype-phenotype relationships in ataxia-telangiectasia and variants.
PG  - 551-61
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, chromosomal instability, 
      radiosensitivity, and cancer predisposition. A-T cells are sensitive to ionizing 
      radiation and radiomimetic chemicals and fail to activate cell-cycle checkpoints 
      after treatment with these agents. The responsible gene, ATM, encodes a large 
      protein kinase with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain. The typical A-T 
      phenotype is caused, in most cases, by null ATM alleles that truncate or severely 
      destabilize the ATM protein. Rare patients with milder manifestations of the 
      clinical or cellular characteristics of the disease have been reported and have been 
      designated "A-T variants." A special variant form of A-T is A-TFresno, which 
      combines a typical A-T phenotype with microcephaly and mental retardation. The 
      possible association of these syndromes with ATM is both important for understanding 
      their molecular basis and essential for counseling and diagnostic purposes. We 
      quantified ATM-protein levels in six A-T variants, and we searched their ATM genes 
      for mutations. Cell lines from these patients exhibited considerable variability in 
      radiosensitivity while showing the typical radioresistant DNA synthesis of A-T 
      cells. Unlike classical A-T patients, these patients exhibited 1%-17% of the normal 
      level of ATM. The underlying ATM genotypes were either homozygous for mutations 
      expected to produce mild phenotypes or compound heterozygotes for a mild and a 
      severe mutation. An A-TFresno cell line was found devoid of the ATM protein and 
      homozygous for a severe ATM mutation. We conclude that certain "A-T variant" 
      phenotypes represent ATM mutations, including some of those without telangiectasia. 
      Our findings extend the range of phenotypes associated with ATM mutations.

      basis.
PG  - 1219-25
AB  - Comparison of the clinical and cellular phenotypes of different genomic instability 
      syndromes provides new insights into functional links in the complex network of the 
      DNA damage response. A prominent example of this principle is provided by 
      examination of three such disorders: ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) caused by lack or 
      inactivation of the ATM protein kinase, which mobilises the cellular response to 
      double strand breaks in the DNA; ataxia-telangiectasia-like disease (ATLD), a result 
      of deficiency of the human Mre11 protein; and the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), 
      which represents defective Nbs1 protein. Mre11 and Nbs1 are members of the 
      Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) protein complex. MRN and its individual components are 
      involved in different responses to cellular damage induced by ionising radiation and 
      radiomimetic chemicals, including complexing with chromatin and with other damage 
      response proteins, formation of radiation-induced foci, and the induction of 
      different cell cycle checkpoints. The phosphorylation of Nbs1 by ATM would indicate 
      that ATM acts upstream of the MRN complex. Consistent with this were the suggestions 
      that ATM could be activated in the absence of fully functional Nbs1 protein. In 
      contrast, the regulation of some ATM target proteins, e.g. Smc1 requires the MRN 
      complex as well as ATM. Nbs1 may, therefore, be both a substrate for ATM and a 
      mediator of ATM function. Recent studies that indicate a requirement of the MRN 
      complex for proper ATM activation suggest that the relationship between ATM and the 
      MRN complex in the DNA damage response is yet to be fully determined. Despite the 
      fact that both Mre11 and Nbs1 are part of the same MRN complex, deficiency in either 
      protein in humans does not lead to the same clinical picture. This suggests that 
      components of the complex may also act separately.

TI  - Mutation analysis of the ATM gene in two Chinese patients with ataxia 
      telangiectasia.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, elevated alpha-fetoprotein 
      level, chromosomal instability, predisposition to cancer, and radiation sensitivity. 
      Although a lot of mutations in the ATM gene have been described, there is still no 
      report about ATM mutations in Chinese population. Using a molecular approach, we 
      screened for ATM mutations in two patients from two unrelated Chinese families. 100 
      normal controls were analyzed to exclude possibility of polymorphism. Two novel 
      mutations in the ATM gene were identified. The first one is a novel, homozygous, 
      1346G>C (Gly449Ala) missense mutation. The second one is a compound heterozygous 
      mutation, which consists of a novel, 610G>T (Gly204Stop) nonsense mutation, combined 
      with a previously reported, 6679C>T (Arg2227Cys) missense mutation. The 
      transversions 1346G>C (Gly449Ala) and 610G>T (Gly204Stop) are not localized either 
      in the conserved PI-3 kinase domain or in the other domains of the ATM protein. The 
      phenotypic features were characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, ocular 
      telangiectasia, elevated alpha-fetoprotein level, immunodeficiency 
      (agammaglo-bulinemia and T-cell defect), and rearrangements of chromosomes 7 and 14; 
      brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy, brain SPECT showed cerebellar regional cerebral 
      blood flow (rCBF) hypoperfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ATM 
      mutations in Mainland China, in which the transversions 1346G>C (Gly449Ala) and 
      610G>T (Gly204Stop) are two novel, disease-causing mutations.

TI  - Nuclear ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) mediates the cellular response to DNA 
      double strand breaks in human neuron-like cells.

LID - S0021-9258(20)55777-3 [pii]

AB  - The protein kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) activates the cellular 
      response to double strand breaks (DSBs), a highly cytotoxic DNA lesion. ATM is 
      activated by DSBs and in turn phosphorylates key players in numerous damage response 
      pathways. ATM is missing or inactivated in the autosomal recessive disorder 
      ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), which is characterized by neuronal degeneration, 
      immunodeficiency, genomic instability, radiation sensitivity, and cancer 
      predisposition. The predominant symptom of A-T is a progressive loss of movement 
      coordination due to ongoing degeneration of the cerebellar cortex and peripheral 
      neuropathy. A major deficiency in understanding A-T is the lack of information on 
      the role of ATM in neurons. It is unclear whether the ATM-mediated DSB response 
      operates in these cells similarly to proliferating cells. Furthermore, ATM was 
      reported to be cytoplasmic in neurons and suggested to function in these cells in 
      capacities other than the DNA damage response. Recently we obtained genetic 
      molecular evidence that the neuronal degeneration in A-T does result from defective 
      DNA damage response. We therefore undertook to investigate this response in a model 
      system of human neuron-like cells (NLCs) obtained by neuronal differentiation in 
      culture. ATM was largely nuclear in NLCs, and their ATM-mediated responses to DSBs 
      were similar to those of proliferating cells. Knocking down ATM did not interfere 
      with neuronal differentiation but abolished ATM-mediated damage responses in NLCs. 
      We concluded that nuclear ATM mediates the DSB response in NLCs similarly to in 
      proliferating cells. Attempts to understand the neurodegeneration in A-T should be 
      directed to investigating the DSB response in the nervous system.

TI  - Mutations in String/CDC25 inhibit cell cycle re-entry and neurodegeneration in a 
      Drosophila model of Ataxia telangiectasia.

AB  - Mutations in ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) result in Ataxia telangiectasia 
      (A-T), a disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. Despite advances 
      in understanding how ATM signals cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis in 
      response to DNA damage, it remains unclear why loss of ATM causes degeneration of 
      post-mitotic neurons and why the neurological phenotype of ATM-null individuals 
      varies in severity. To address these issues, we generated a Drosophila model of A-T. 
      RNAi knockdown of ATM in the eye caused progressive degeneration of adult neurons in 
      the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage. Heterozygous mutations in select 
      genes modified the neurodegeneration phenotype, suggesting that genetic background 
      underlies variable neurodegeneration in A-T. The neuroprotective activity of ATM may 
      be negatively regulated by deacetylation since mutations in a protein deacetylase 
      gene, RPD3, suppressed neurodegeneration, and a human homolog of RPD3, histone 
      deacetylase 2, bound ATM and abrogated ATM activation in cell culture. Moreover, 
      knockdown of ATM in post-mitotic neurons caused cell cycle re-entry, and 
      heterozygous mutations in the cell cycle activator gene String/CDC25 inhibited cell 
      cycle re-entry and neurodegeneration. Thus, we hypothesize that ATM performs a cell 
      cycle checkpoint function to protect post-mitotic neurons from degeneration and that 
      cell cycle re-entry causes neurodegeneration in A-T.

TI  - Presence of ATM protein and residual kinase activity correlates with the phenotype 
      in ataxia-telangiectasia: a genotype-phenotype study.
PG  - 561-71
LID - 10.1002/humu.22016 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder 
      with multisystem involvement and cancer predisposition, caused by mutations in the 
      A-T mutated (ATM) gene. To study genotype-phenotype correlations, we evaluated the 
      clinical and laboratory data of 51 genetically proven A-T patients, and additionally 
      measured ATM protein expression and kinase activity. Patients without ATM kinase 
      activity showed the classical phenotype. The presence of ATM protein, correlated 
      with slightly better immunological function. Residual kinase activity correlated 
      with a milder and essentially different neurological phenotype, absence of 
      telangiectasia, normal endocrine and pulmonary function, normal immunoglobulins, 
      significantly lower X-ray hypersensitivity in lymphocytes, and extended lifespan. In 
      these patients, cancer occurred later in life and generally consisted of solid 
      instead of lymphoid malignancies. The genotypes of severely affected patients 
      generally included truncating mutations resulting in total absence of ATM kinase 
      activity, while patients with milder phenotypes harbored at least one missense or 
      splice site mutation resulting in expression of ATM with some kinase activity. 
      Overall, the phenotypic manifestations in A-T show a continuous spectrum from severe 
      classical childhood-onset A-T to a relatively mild adult-onset disorder, depending 
      on the presence of ATM protein and kinase activity. Each patient is left with a 
      tremendously increased cancer risk.

TI  - Characterisation of ATM mutations in Slavic Ataxia telangiectasia patients.
PG  - 204-11
LID - 10.1007/s12017-011-8152-z [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a genomic instability syndrome characterised, among 
      others, by progressive cerebellar degeneration, oculocutaneous telangiectases, 
      immunodeficiency, elevated serum alpha-phetoprotein level, chromosomal breakage, 
      hypersensitivity to ionising radiation and increased cancer risk. This autosomal 
      recessive disorder is caused by mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) 
      gene coding for serine/threonine protein kinase with a crucial role in response to 
      DNA double-strand breaks. We characterised genotype and phenotype of 12 Slavic AT 
      patients from 11 families. Mutation analysis included sequencing of the entire 
      coding sequence, adjacent intron regions, 3'UTR and 5'UTR of the ATM gene and 
      multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for the detection of large 
      deletions/duplications at the ATM locus. The high incidence of new and individual 
      mutations demonstrates a marked mutational heterogeneity of AT in the Czech 
      Republic. Our data indicate that sequence analysis of the entire coding region of 
      ATM is sufficient for a high detection rate of mutations in ATM and that MLPA 
      analysis for the detection of deletions/duplications seems to be redundant in the 
      Slavic population.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, 
      chromosomal instability, radiosensitivity, and cancer predisposition. The gene 
      mutated in the patients, ATM, encodes a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
      family proteins. The ATM protein has a key role in the cellular response to DNA 
      damage. Truncating and splice site mutations in ATM have been found in most patients 
      with the classical AT phenotype. Here we report of our extensive ATM mutation 
      screening on 25 AT patients from 19 families of different ethnic origin. Previously 
      unknown mutations were identified in six patients including a new homozygous 
      missense mutation, c.8110T>C (p.Cys2704Arg), in a severely affected patient. 
      Comprehensive clinical data are presented for all patients described here along with 
      data on ATM function generated by analysis of cell lines established from a subset 
      of the patients.

PG  - 30133-41
AB  - We have assessed several ataxia Telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent functions in 
      cells derived from ataxia telangiectasia patients, carrying either an ATM 5762ins137 
      splice site or a 7271T-->G missense mutation, with a less severe phenotype compared 
      with the classical disorder. ATM kinase in vitro, from 5762ins137 cells, showed the 
      same specific activity as ATM in normal cells, but the protein was present at low 
      levels. In contrast, mutant ATM kinase activity in the 7271T-->G cells was only 
      about 6% that of the activity in normal cells, although the level of mutant protein 
      expressed was similar to normal cells. Phosphorylation of the DNA double strand 
      break repair proteins Nbs1 and hMre11, following DNA damage, was observed in normal 
      and 7271T-->G cells but was almost absent in both 5762ins137 and classical ataxia 
      telangiectasia cells. The kinetics of p53 response was intermediate between normal 
      and classical ataxia telangiectasia cells in both the 7271T-->G and 5762ins137 
      cells, but interestingly, c-Jun kinase activation following DNA damage was equally 
      deficient in cell lines derived from all the ataxia telangiectasia patients. Our 
      results indicate that levels of ATM kinase activity, but not induction of p53 or 
      c-Jun kinase activity, in these cells correlate with the degree of neurological 
      disorder in the patients.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by radiosensitivity, genomic instability, and predisposition to 
      cancer. A-T is caused by biallelic mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated 
      (ATM) gene, but heterozygous carriers, though apparently healthy, are believed to be 
      at increased risk for cancer and more sensitive to ionizing radiation than the 
      general population. Despite progress in functional and sequencing-based assays, no 
      straightforward, rapid, and inexpensive test is available for the identification of 
      A-T homozygotes and heterozygotes, which is essential for diagnosis, genetic 
      counseling, and carrier prediction. The oncosuppressor p53 prevents genomic 
      instability and centrosomal amplification. During mitosis, p53 localizes at the 
      centrosome in an ATM-dependent manner. We capitalized on the latter finding and 
      established a simple, fast, minimally invasive, reliable, and inexpensive test to 
      determine mutant ATM zygosity. The percentage of mitotic lymphoblasts or PBMCs 
      bearing p53 centrosomal localization clearly discriminated among healthy donors 
      (>75%), A-T heterozygotes (40%-56%), and A-T homozygotes (<30%). The test is 
      specific for A-T, independent of the type of ATM mutations, and recognized 
      tumor-associated ATM polymorphisms. In a preliminary study, our test confirmed that 
      ATM is a breast cancer susceptibility gene. These data open the possibility of 
      cost-effective, early diagnosis of A-T homozygotes and large-scale screenings for 
      heterozygotes.

TI  - Targeted integration of functional human ATM cDNA into genome mediated by HSV/AAV 
      hybrid amplicon vector.
PG  - 81-8
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, cancer predisposition, genome instability, and 
      sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). We have previously shown that a herpes 
      simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) amplicon vector carrying the human 
      ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) complementary DNA (cDNA) is able to correct 
      aspects of the cellular phenotype of human A-T cells in culture, and is also able to 
      transfer the ATM cDNA to the Atm(-/-) mouse cerebellum. In order to achieve stable 
      gene replacement, we have generated an HSV/adeno-associated virus (AAV) hybrid 
      amplicon vector carrying the expression cassettes for the ATM cDNA [(9.2 kilobases 
      (kb)] and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), flanked by AAV inverted 
      terminal repeats (ITRs). This hybrid vector, in the presence of AAV Rep proteins, 
      mediates site-specific integration into the AAVS1 site on chromosome 19 in human 
      cells and in Atm(-/-) mice carrying that human locus. The functional activity of the 
      vector-derived ATM was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by ATM autophosphorylation at 
      Ser-1981 after IR. This proof-of-principle study establishes the ability of HSV/AAV 
      hybrid amplicon vectors to mediate functional targeted integration of the ATM cDNA 
      into A-T cells in culture and in Atm(-/-) mice in vivo, thus laying a foundation for 
      possible gene therapy approaches in the treatment of A-T patients.

PG  - 1009-15
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is one of a group of autosomal recessive cerebellar 
      ataxias. Presentation is usually by the age of 2 years and ataxia of both upper and 
      lower limbs develops, such that by early teenage most patients require a wheelchair 
      for mobility. Speech and eye movement are also affected. Other important features 
      are t(7;14) translocations, immunodeficiency, a high serum alpha fetoprotein 
      concentration, growth retardation, telangiectasia-most noticeably on the bulbar 
      conjunctiva-and a very high risk of developing a lymphoid tumour. Patients also show 
      an increased sensitivity to ionising radiation. The classic form of A-T results from 
      the presence of two truncating ATM mutations, leading to total loss of the ATM 
      protein, a protein kinase. Importantly, A-T shows clinical heterogeneity, including 
      milder forms where neurological progression may be slower or of later onset. In 
      these cases there is a correlation between the preservation of neurological 
      function, decreased radiosensitivity, and the degree of retained ATM protein kinase 
      activity. Considerable scope remains for understanding the progress of the disorder 
      in relation to the types of ATM mutation present.

AB  - Immunodeficiency affects over half of all patients with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) 
      and when present can contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. A 
      retrospective review of clinical history, immunological findings, ataxia 
      telangiectasia mutated (ATM) enzyme activity and ATM mutation type was conducted on 
      80 consecutive patients attending the National Clinic for Ataxia Telangiectasia, 
      Nottingham, UK between 1994 and 2006. The aim was to characterize the 
      immunodeficiency in A-T and determine its relationship to the ATM mutations present. 
      Sixty-one patients had mutations resulting in complete loss of ATM kinase activity 
      (group A) and 19 patients had leaky splice or missense mutations resulting in 
      residual kinase activity (group B). There was a significantly higher proportion of 
      patients with recurrent sinopulmonary infections in group A compared with group B 
      (31 of 61 versus four of 19 P = 0.03) and a greater need for prophylactic 
      antibiotics (30 of 61 versus one of 19 P = 0.001). Comparing group A with group B 
      patients, 25 of 46 had undetectable/low immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels compared with 
      none of 19; T cell lymphopenia was found in 28 of 56 compared with one of 18 and B 
      cell lymphopenia in 35 of 55 compared with four of 18 patients (P = 0.00004, 0.001 
      and 0.003 respectively). Low IgG2 subclass levels and low levels of antibodies to 
      pneumococcal polysaccharide were more common in group A than group B (16 of 27 
      versus one of 11 P = 0.01; 34/43 versus six of 17 P = 0.002) patients. Ig 
      replacement therapy was required in 10 (12.5%) of the whole cohort, all in group A. 
      In conclusion, A-T patients with no ATM kinase activity had a markedly more severe 
      immunological phenotype than those expressing low levels of ATM activity.

TI  - ATM haplotypes and associated mutations in Iranian patients with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia: recurring homozygosity without a founder haplotype.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations 
      in the ATM gene. The ATM gene spans more than 150 kb at chromosomal region 11q23.1 
      and encodes a product of 3,056 amino acids. The ATM protein is a serine/threonine 
      protein kinase and is involved in oxidative stress, cell cycle control, and DNA 
      repair. We analyzed the 11q22-23 haplotypes and associated mutations of 16 Iranian 
      families. We utilized standardized short tandem repeat (STR) haplotypes to enhance 
      mutation identification. In addition to the STR markers, single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism haplotypes were determined, using three critical polymorphisms. The 
      entire gene was screened sequentially by protein truncation testing, single-strand 
      conformation polymorphism, and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography to 
      identify the disease-causing mutations. Of the expected 32 mutations, 25 (78%) were 
      identified. All but two mutations led to a truncated or null form of the ATM protein 
      (nonsense, splice site, or frameshift). Twelve mutations were identified for 15 
      haplotypes. Five mutations were novel. Mutations were located throughout the entire 
      gene, with no clustering. Despite the absence of an Iranian founder mutation, 
      three-fourths of the families were homozygous, suggesting that many undetected ATM 
      mutations still exist in Iran. This study establishes a database for Iranian A-T 
      families, and extends the global spectrum of ATM mutations.

TI  - Underexpression and abnormal localization of ATM products in ataxia telangiectasia 
      patients bearing ATM missense mutations.
PG  - 305-12
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2011.196 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immune defects and 
      predisposition to malignancies. A-T is caused by biallelic inactivation of the ATM 
      gene, in most cases by frameshift or nonsense mutations. More rarely, ATM missense 
      mutations with unknown consequences on ATM function are found, making definitive 
      diagnosis more challenging. In this study, a series of 15 missense mutations, 
      including 11 not previously reported, were identified in 16 patients with clinical 
      diagnosis of A-T belonging to 14 families and 1 patient with atypical clinical 
      features. ATM function was evaluated in patient lymphoblastoid cell lines by 
      measuring H2AX and KAP1 phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation, 
      confirming the A-T diagnosis for 16 cases. In accordance with previous studies, we 
      showed that missense mutations associated with A-T often lead to ATM protein 
      underexpression (15 out of 16 cases). In addition, we demonstrated that most 
      missense mutations lead to an abnormal cytoplasmic localization of ATM, correlated 
      with its decreased expression. This new finding highlights ATM mislocalization as a 
      new mechanism of ATM dysfunction, which may lead to therapeutic strategies for 
      missense mutation associated A-T.

TI  - Requirement of the MRN complex for ATM activation by DNA damage.
PG  - 5612-21
AB  - The ATM protein kinase is a primary activator of the cellular response to DNA 
      double-strand breaks (DSBs). In response to DSBs, ATM is activated and 
      phosphorylates key players in various branches of the DNA damage response network. 
      ATM deficiency causes the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), 
      characterized by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, radiation sensitivity, 
      chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition. The MRN complex, whose core 
      contains the Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1 proteins, is involved in the initial processing 
      of DSBs. Hypomorphic mutations in the NBS1 and MRE11 genes lead to two other genomic 
      instability disorders: the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) and A-T like disease 
      (A-TLD), respectively. The order in which ATM and MRN act in the early phase of the 
      DSB response is unclear. Here we show that functional MRN is required for ATM 
      activation, and consequently for timely activation of ATM-mediated pathways. 
      Collectively, these and previous results assign to components of the MRN complex 
      roles upstream and downstream of ATM in the DNA damage response pathway and explain 
      the clinical resemblance between A-T and A-TLD.

AB  - We screened individuals from 443 familial breast cancer pedigrees and 521 controls 
      for ATM sequence variants and identified 12 mutations in affected individuals and 
      two in controls (P = 0.0047). The results demonstrate that ATM mutations that cause 
      ataxia-telangiectasia in biallelic carriers are breast cancer susceptibility alleles 
      in monoallelic carriers, with an estimated relative risk of 2.37 (95% confidence 
      interval (c.i.) = 1.51-3.78, P = 0.0003). There was no evidence that other classes 
      of ATM variant confer a risk of breast cancer.

TI  - Expression of ATM in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts rescues defects in DNA 
      double-strand break repair in nuclear extracts.
PG  - 128-40
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a human genetic disorder characterized by progressive 
      cerebellar degeneration, hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR), 
      immunodeficiency, and high cancer risk. At the cellular level, IR sensitivity and 
      increased frequency of spontaneous and IR-induced chromosomal breakage and 
      rearrangements are the hallmarks of A-T. The ATM gene, mutated in this syndrome, has 
      been cloned and codes for a protein sharing homology with DNA-PKcs, a protein kinase 
      involved in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and DNA damage responses. The 
      characteristics of the A-T cellular phenotypes and ATM gene suggest that ATM may 
      play a role similar to that of DNA-PKcs in DSB repair and that there is a primary 
      DNA repair defect in A-T cells. In the current study, the function of ATM in DNA DSB 
      repair was evaluated in an in vitro system using two plasmids, carrying either an 
      EcoRI-induced DSB within the lacZalpha gene or various endonuclease-induced DSB in 
      the SupF suppressor tRNA gene. We found that the DSB repair efficiency in A-T 
      nuclear extracts was comparable to, if not higher than, that in normal nuclear 
      extracts. However, the repair fidelity in A-T nuclear extracts was decreased when 
      repairing DSB with short 5' and 3' overhangs (<4 base pairs (bp)) or blunt ends, but 
      not 5' 4-bp overhangs. Sequencing of the mutant plasmids revealed that deletions 
      involving 1-6 nucleotide microhomologies were the major class of mutations in both 
      A-T and normal extracts. However, the size of the deletions in plasmids from A-T 
      nuclear extracts was larger than that from normal nuclear extracts. Expression of 
      the ATM protein in A-T cells corrected the defect in DSB repair in A-T nuclear 
      extracts. These results suggest that ATM plays a role in maintaining genomic 
      stability by preventing the repair of DSB from an error-prone pathway.

TI  - Impaired genomic stability and increased oxidative stress exacerbate different 
      features of Ataxia-telangiectasia.
PG  - 2929-43
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a multisystem, cancer-predisposing genetic disorder 
      caused by deficiency of the ATM protein. To dissect the A-T phenotype, we augmented 
      specific features of the human disease by generating mouse strains that combine Atm 
      deficiency with dysfunction of other proteins. Increasing oxidative stress by 
      combining deficiencies in Atm and superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) exacerbated growth 
      retardation and markedly reduced the mean survival time following ionizing 
      radiation. In contrast, increasing genomic instability by combining deficiencies of 
      Atm and the mismatch repair protein Mlh1 caused a moderate increase in radiation 
      sensitivity and dramatic increase in aggressive lymphomas, compared with thes Atm-/- 
      single knockout. Remarkably, Atm, Mlh1 or Mlh1/Atm single or double heterozygosity 
      did not significantly affect the life span of the various genotypes. Mlh1/Atm double 
      null tumors were polyclonal, whereas the tumors in other genotypes were mono- or 
      oligoclonal, demonstrating the high predisposition of thymocytes with this genotype 
      to become malignant. Chromosomal aberrations in the tumors were localized mainly in 
      chromosomes 12 and 15. The genomic region on chromosome 15, which contains the gene 
      for the c-Myc oncoprotein, was commonly amplified, and elevated levels of the c-Myc 
      protein were subsequently observed in the tumors. Our data suggest that impaired 
      genomic instability is an important contributing factor to cancer predisposition in 
      A-T, whereas oxidative stress is more important in the radiation sensitivity and 
      growth retardation facets of this disease.

TI  - A novel phenotypic marker for ATM-deficient 129S6/SvEvTac-ATMtm1Awb/J mice.
PG  - 243-50
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      neuronal degeneration as well as many other physiological and somatic defects. ATM 
      (A-T, mutated), the gene mutated in A-T, encodes a 370 kDa protein kinase. ATM 
      knockout mouse models (ATM(-/-)) show growth retardation, infertility, neurological 
      dysfunction, defects in T-lymphocytes, and extreme sensitivity to ionizing 
      radiation. We have recently established multiple ATM(+/-) breeding pairs and 
      discovered that all ATM(-/-) offspring exhibit a nonpigmented section of tail, 
      usually at or near the tip. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a 
      phenotype of nonpigmented tail has been reported in ATM(-/-) knockout mice. We 
      believe that the sections of nonpigmented tail of 129S6/SvEvTac-ATM(tm1Awb)/J mice 
      provide a novel phenotypic marker for research using this ATM knockout mouse model. 
      Results from histochemistry and immunoblotting analysis further demonstrate that 
      while melanocyte precursors or melanoblasts are present in the nonpigmented tail 
      tissue of ATM(-/-) mice, they fail to differentiate fully into mature melanocytes. 
      The potential connection between this phenotype and other clinical symptoms caused 
      by ATM deficiency, such as progressive neuronal degeneration, is discussed in this 
      article.

TI  - Functional and computational assessment of missense variants in the 
      ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene: mutations with increased cancer risk.
PG  - 12-21
LID - 10.1002/humu.20805 [doi]
AB  - The functional consequences of missense variants are often difficult to predict. 
      This becomes especially relevant when DNA sequence changes are used to determine a 
      diagnosis or prognosis. To analyze the consequences of 12 missense variants in 
      patients with mild forms of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), we employed site-directed 
      mutagenesis of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) cDNA followed by stable 
      transfections into a single A-T cell line to isolate the effects of each allele on 
      the cellular phenotype. After induction of the transfected cells with CdCl2, we 
      monitored for successful ATM transcription and subsequently assessed: 1) 
      intracellular ATM protein levels; 2) ionizing radiation (IR)-induced ATM kinase 
      activity; and 3) cellular radiosensitivity. We then calculated SIFT and PolyPhen 
      scores for the missense changes. Nine variants produced little or no correction of 
      the A-T cellular phenotype and were interpreted to be ATM mutations; SIFT/PolyPhen 
      scores supported this. Three variants corrected the cellular phenotype, suggesting 
      that they represented benign variants or polymorphisms. SIFT and PolyPhen scores 
      supported the functional analyses for one of these variants (c.1709T>C); the other 
      two were predicted to be "not tolerated" (c.6188G>A and c.6325T>G) and were 
      classified as "operationally neutral." Genotype/phenotype relationships were 
      compared: three deleterious missense variants were associated with an increased risk 
      of cancer (c.6679C>T, c.7271T>G, and c.8494C>T). In situ mutagenesis represents an 
      effective experimental approach for distinguishing deleterious missense mutations 
      from benign or operationally neutral missense variants.

TI  - Breaks invisible to the DNA damage response machinery accumulate in ATM-deficient 
      cells.
PG  - 745-59
LID - 10.1002/gcc.20679 [doi]
AB  - After irradiation, ATM defective cells accumulate unrepaired double strand breaks 
      (DSBs) for several cell divisions. At the chromosome level, unresolved DSBs appear 
      as chromosome breaks that can be efficiently scored by using telomeric and mFISH 
      probes. H2AX is immediately activated by ATM in response to DNA damage and its 
      phosphorylated form, gammaH2AX, flanks the DSB through several megabases. The 
      gammaH2AX-labeling status of broken chromosome ends was analyzed in AT cells to 
      check whether the DNA damage response was accurately taking place in these 
      persistent DSBs. The results show that one quarter of the scored breaks are devoid 
      of gammaH2AX foci in metaphase spreads from ATM-deficient cells, and this fraction 
      is significantly higher than in normal cells (chi(2) < 0.05). Accumulation of sensor 
      and repair proteins at damaged sites is a key event in the cellular response to 
      DSBs, so MRE11 labeling at broken ends was also analyzed. While all gammaH2AX foci 
      scored at visible broken ends colocalize with MRE11 foci, all gammaH2AX-unlabeled 
      breaks are also devoid of MRE11-labeling. The present results suggest that a 
      significant subset of the AT long-lived DSBs may persist as "invisible" DSBs due to 
      deficient detection by the DNA damage repair machinery. Eventually the properly 
      signaled DSBs will be repaired while invisible breaks may indefinitely accumulate; 
      most probably contributing to the AT cells' well known genomic instability.

TI  - Severe reaction to radiotherapy for breast cancer as the presenting feature of 
      ataxia telangiectasia.
PG  - 262-8
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2011.534 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe early and late radiation reaction to radiotherapy is extremely 
      rare in breast cancer patients. Such a reaction prompted an investigation into a 
      44-year-old mother (patient A-T213). METHODS: A neurological examination was 
      performed and blood lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts were assessed for 
      radiosensitivity chromosomally and by colony-forming assay. The ATM gene was 
      sequenced and ATM mutations modelled by site-directed mutagenesis. The ATM kinase 
      activity was also assessed. RESULTS: Patient A-T213 was normally ambulant with no 
      ataxia and minimal other neurological features. T lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts 
      were unusually radiosensitive, although less sensitive than in classical ataxia 
      telangiectasia (A-T). A lymphoblastoid cell line and skin fibroblasts expressed ATM 
      protein with some retained kinase activity. One missense ATM mutation c.8672G>A 
      (p.Gly2891Asp) and a c.1A>G substitution were identified. In the modelling system, 
      the p.Gly2891Asp mutant protein was expressed and shown to have residual ATM kinase 
      activity. CONCLUSION: Patient A-T213 has a milder form of A-T with biallelic ATM 
      mutations, which may have contributed to breast cancer development, and certainly 
      caused the severe radiation reaction. Ataxia telangiectasia should be investigated 
      as a potential cause of untoward severe early and late radiation reactions in breast 
      cancer patients.

TI  - Lymphoid tumours and breast cancer in ataxia telangiectasia; substantial protective 
      effect of residual ATM kinase activity against childhood tumours.
PG  - 586-91
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2011.266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunodeficiency in ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is less severe in 
      patients expressing some mutant or normal ATM kinase activity. We, therefore, 
      determined whether expression of residual ATM kinase activity also protected against 
      tumour development in A-T. METHODS: From a total of 296 consecutive genetically 
      confirmed A-T patients from the British Isles and the Netherlands, we identified 66 
      patients who developed a malignant tumour; 47 lymphoid tumours and 19 non-lymphoid 
      tumours were diagnosed. We determined their ATM mutations, and whether cells from 
      these patients expressed any ATM with residual ATM kinase activity. RESULTS: In 
      childhood, total absence of ATM kinase activity was associated, almost exclusively, 
      with development of lymphoid tumours. There was an overwhelming preponderance of 
      tumours in patients <16 years without kinase activity compared with those with some 
      residual activity, consistent with a substantial protective effect of residual ATM 
      kinase activity against tumour development in childhood. In addition, the presence 
      of eight breast cancers in A-T patients, a 30-fold increased risk, establishes 
      breast cancer as part of the A-T phenotype. CONCLUSION: Overall, a spectrum of 
      tumour types is associated with A-T, consistent with involvement of ATM in different 
      mechanisms of tumour formation. Tumour type was influenced by ATM allelic 
      heterogeneity, residual ATM kinase activity and age.

TI  - The ATM gene and ataxia telangiectasia.
PG  - 401-5
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disorder 
      characterized by chromosome instability, radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency and a 
      predisposition for cancer. Epidemiological studies have shown that AT heterozygotes 
      have a predisposition for cancer, especially for breast cancer in women. The disease 
      is caused by mutations in the ATM gene, leading to total loss of the ATM protein, 
      which normally recognizes DNA damage, activates the DNA repair machinery and the 
      cell cycle check points in order to minimize the risk of genetic damage. This review 
      summarizes the clinical features of AT and the natural history of the disease and 
      puts recent molecular advances into the context of the cellular and clinical 
      phenotype.

AB  - A recent challenge for investigators studying the progressive neurological disease 
      ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is to identify mutations whose effects might be 
      alleviated by mutation-targeted therapies. We studied ATM mutations in eight 
      families of Japanese A-T patients (JPAT) and were able to identify all 16 mutations. 
      The probands were compound heterozygotes in seven families, and one (JPAT2) was 
      homozygous for a frameshift mutation. All mutations--four frameshift, two nonsense, 
      four large genomic deletions, and six affecting splicing--were novel except for 
      c.748C>T found in family JPAT6 and c.2639-384A>G found in family JPAT11/12. Using an 
      established lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) of patient JPAT11, ATM protein was 
      restored to levels approaching wild type by exposure to an antisense morpholino 
      oligonucleotide designed to correct a pseudoexon splicing mutation. In addition, in 
      an LCL from patient JPAT8/9, a heterozygous carrier of a nonsense mutation, ATM 
      levels could also be partially restored by exposure to readthrough compounds (RTCs): 
      an aminoglycoside, G418, and a novel small molecule identified in our laboratory, 
      RTC13. Taken together, our results suggest that screening and functional 
      characterization of the various sorts of mutations affecting the ATM gene can lead 
      to better identification of A-T patients who are most likely to benefit from rapidly 
      developing mutation-targeted therapeutic technologies.

TI  - Molecular basis of ataxia telangiectasia and related diseases.
PG  - 897-907
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare human disease characterized by extreme cellular 
      sensitivity to radiation and a predisposition to cancer, with a hallmark of onset in 
      early childhood. Several human diseases also share similar symptoms with AT albeit 
      with different degrees of severity and different associated disorders. While all AT 
      patients contain mutations in the AT-mutated gene (ATM), most other AT-like 
      disorders are defective in genes encoding an MRN protein complex consisting of 
      Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1. Both ATM and MRN function as cellular sensors to DNA 
      double-strand breaks, which lead to the recruitment and phosphorylation of an array 
      of substrate proteins involved in DNA repair, apoptosis and cell-cycle checkpoints, 
      as well as gene regulation, translation initiation and telomere maintenance. ATM is 
      a member of the family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinases (PIKK), 
      and the discovery of many ATM substrates provides the underlying mechanisms of 
      heterologous symptoms among AT patients. This review article focuses on recent 
      findings related to the initial recognition of double-strand breaks by ATM and MRN, 
      as well as a DNA-dependent protein kinase complex consisting of the heterodimer 
      Ku70/Ku80 and its catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs, another member of PIKK. This possible 
      interaction suggests that a much greater complex is involved in sensing, transducing 
      and co-ordinating cellular events in response to genome instability.

TI  - Characterization of the porcine ATM gene: towards the generation of a novel 
      non-murine animal model for Ataxia-Telangiectasia.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is a genetic disorder causing cerebellar degeneration, 
      immune deficiency, cancer predisposition, chromosomal instability and radiation 
      sensitivity. Among the mutations responsible for A-T, 85% represent truncating 
      mutations that result in the production of shorter, highly unstable forms of ATM 
      (AT-mutated) protein leading to a null ATM phenotype. Several ATM-deficient mice 
      have been created however none reflects the extent of neurological degeneration 
      observed in humans. In an attempt to identify an alternative animal model, we have 
      characterized the porcine ortholog of ATM (pATM). When compared to the human ATM 
      (hATM), the pATM showed a high level of homology in the coding region, particularly 
      in the regions coding for functional domains, and had extensive alternative splicing 
      of the 5'UTR, characteristic for the human ATM mRNA. Six different 5'UTRs resulting 
      from alternative splicing of the first three exons were identified. The porcine 
      5'UTRs varied in size, had multiple ATG codons and different secondary structures, 
      supporting the possibility of complex transcriptional regulation. Three of the six 
      transcripts demonstrated alternative splicing of exon 3, the first putative coding 
      exon, altering the translation start and giving rise to a putative protein lacking 
      the N-terminus substrate binding domain (82-89 aa) involved in activation of human 
      p53 and BRCA1 pathways. Real time-PCR analysis revealed variable expression levels 
      of total ATM transcripts in individual tissues. Although each splice variant was 
      ubiquitously expressed among the tissues, differences in the relative abundances of 
      specific 5'UTRs were observed. The extensive alternative splicing of the pATM gene 
      resembles the complex splicing observed in the hATM and could provide insights for 
      differences observed between mice and humans with regards to the onset of A-T. Thus, 
      the pig may provide a more relevant clinical model of A-T.

TI  - Ataxia-telangiectasia genes and breast cancer risk in a French family study.
PG  - 73-80
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a rare autosomal recessive early childhood disorder, 
      characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration, immunological deficiency, 
      radiosensitivity and an increased risk of cancer caused in most cases by mutations 
      in the AT-mutated gene (ATM). Epidemiological studies on AT families have shown that 
      AT heterozygous women have an increased risk of developing breast cancer (BC). The 
      ATM protein plays a central role in the recognition and repair of DNA double-strand 
      breaks and the subsequent activation of cell-cycle checkpoints. Whilst AT is a rare 
      disease, 0.5-1 % of the general population are estimated to be AT mutation carriers, 
      thus any increases in the risks of cancer associated with ATM carrier status are of 
      public health relevance. The main results of our published studies on the risk of BC 
      in 34 French AT families according to heterozygote status, type of ATM mutation and 
      exogenous factors are summarized here. The risk of BC was higher in ATM heterozygous 
      (HetATM) women and did not differ significantly according to the type of ATM 
      mutation (missense vs truncating) carried by the AT family members but appeared 
      associated with the position of some truncating mutations in certain binding domains 
      of the ATM protein. The effect of exogenous factors, such as reproductive life 
      factors and exposure to ionizing radiation, on the risk of BC according to ATM 
      heterozygote status was assessed. There was no evidence for interaction (except for 
      age at first full-term pregnancy). These findings does not appear to justify a 
      separate screening program from that already available to other women with a 
      first-degree relative affected by BC, as their risks have similar amplitude. Chest 
      X-rays did not appear to be a risk factor for BC in our study population. More 
      powerful studies, using data sets pooled from international sources are being set up 
      to confirm these observations.

TI  - Functional characterization connects individual patient mutations in ataxia 
      telangiectasia mutated (ATM) with dysfunction of specific DNA double-strand 
      break-repair signaling pathways.
PG  - 3849-60
LID - 10.1096/fj.11-185546 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) has multiple functions in homologous 
      recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which lead to conflicting 
      data regarding its DNA double-strand break-repair (DSBR) functions in previous 
      studies. To explore the effect of clinically relevant ATM mutations, we 
      characterized DSBR between mutated EGFP genes and ATM kinase signaling in 9 
      lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from patients with ataxia telangiectasia 
      (AT) with defined vs. 3 control LCLs without ATM mutations. Our study revealed that 
      the DSBR phenotype in AT cells is not uniform but appears to depend on the mutation, 
      causing up to 32-fold increased or up to 3-fold decreased activities in particular 
      pathways. Comparison with a further 10 LCLs mutated in downstream factors (BRCA1, 
      BRCA2, Nibrin, Rad50, and Chk2) showed that the most diametrically opposed DSBR 
      patterns in AT cells phenocopied NBN/RAD50 or BRCA1 mutations. Notably, reexpressing 
      wild-type ATM reversed these defects by 2.3- to 3.5-fold. Our data suggest that ATM 
      stimulates repair proteins such as Nibrin, which execute HR, single-strand annealing 
      (SSA), and NHEJ. Concomitantly, ATM minimizes error-prone repair (SSA and NHEJ) 
      through activation of surveillance factors such as BRCA1. Since the outcome of the 
      individual defect can be diametrically opposed, distinguishing repair patterns in 
      patients with ATM mutations may also be relevant regarding therapeutic responses.

TI  - Relationship between DNA double-strand break rejoining and cell survival after 
      exposure to ionizing radiation in human fibroblast strains with differing ATM/p53 
      status: implications for evaluation of clinical radiosensitivity.
PG  - 1498-505
AB  - PURPOSE: To better understand the impact of defects in the DNA damage-surveillance 
      network on the various cell-based assays used for the prediction of patient 
      radiosensitivity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We examined noncancerous human fibroblast 
      strains from individuals with ataxia telangiectasia (ataxia telangiectasia mutated 
      [ATM] deficient) or Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53 deficient) using the neutral comet, 
      H2AX phosphorylation, and clonogenic survival assays. RESULTS: Using the comet 
      assay, we found that, compared with normal fibroblasts, cells lacking either ATM or 
      p53 function exhibited a reduced rate of double-strand break (DSB) rejoining early 
      (< or =4 h) after exposure to 8 Gy of gamma-radiation and also exhibited high levels 
      of unrejoined DSBs later after irradiation. ATM-deficient and p53-deficient 
      fibroblasts also exhibited abnormally increased levels of phosphorylated H2AX 
      (gamma-H2AX) at later intervals after irradiation. In the clonogenic assay, 
      ATM-deficient cells exhibited marked radiosensitivity and p53-deficient cells had 
      varying degrees of radioresistance compared with normal fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: 
      Regardless of whether ataxia telangiectasia and Li-Fraumeni syndrome fibroblasts are 
      DSB-repair deficient per se, it is apparent that p53 and ATM defects greatly 
      influence the cellular phenotype as evidenced by the neutral comet and gamma-H2AX 
      assays. Our data suggest that the gamma-H2AX levels observed at later intervals 
      after irradiation may represent a reliable measure of the overall DSB rejoining 
      capabilities of human fibroblasts. However, it appears that using this parameter as 
      a predictor of radiosensitivity without knowledge of the cells' p53 status could 
      lead to incorrect conclusions.

TI  - Loss of ATM positively regulates the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 
      (HIF-1) through oxidative stress: Role in the physiopathology of the disease.
PG  - 2814-22
AB  - Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a 
      wide variety of progressive clinical symptoms. This includes neuronal degeneration, 
      oculocutaneous telangiectasias, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency, increased risk 
      of cancer and sensitivity to ionizing radiation. The gene mutated in this disease, 
      ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated), encodes a protein kinase involved in DNA double 
      strand breaks signalling and repair. ATM deficient cells also display an increase in 
      oxidative stress, by poorly characterized mechanism(s), which clearly contributes to 
      the neurodegenerative aspect of the disease. Despite these advances, the occurrence 
      of the vascular abnormalities, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance remains 
      poorly understood. In different cellular models where ATM expression was disrupted, 
      we demonstrated that the absence of ATM leads to an increased expression of both 
      subunits of the transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1). We also 
      observed enhanced trans-activating functions of HIF-1. HIF-1 is the central 
      regulator of responses to hypoxia which induces the transcription of genes involved 
      in angiogenesis (e.g., VEGF-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) and cellular 
      metabolism (e.g., GLUT-1). Interestingly, we demonstrated that ATM disruption 
      positively regulates both expression and function of the basal glucose transporter 
      GLUT-1 as well as the proangiogenic factor, VEGF. In addition, our results suggest 
      that the absence of ATM increases HIF-1 proteins biosynthesis, and this effect is 
      dependant on the oxidative stress existing in ATM deficient cells. Our compelling 
      results highlight a new link between ATM deficiency and the clinical features of the 
      disease and provide a molecular link between ATM downregulation and the increase in 
      tumor angiogenesis observed in human breast cancers.

TI  - DHPLC screening of ATM gene in Italian patients affected by ataxia-telangiectasia: 
      fourteen novel ATM mutations.
PG  - 257-64
AB  - The gene for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T:MIM: #208900), ATM, spans about 150 kb of 
      genomic DNA and is composed of 62 coding exons. ATM mutations are found along the 
      entire coding sequence of the gene, without evidence of mutational hot spots. Using 
      DNA as the starting material, we used denaturing high performance liquid 
      chromatography (DHPLC) technique to search for ATM gene mutations. Initially, DHPLC 
      was validated in a retrospective study of 16 positive control samples that included 
      19 known mutations; 100% of mutations were detected. Subsequently, DHPLC was used to 
      screen for mutations a cohort of 22 patients with the classical form of A-T. A total 
      of 27 different mutations were identified on 38 of the 44 alleles, corresponding to 
      a 86% detection rate. Fourteen of the mutations were novel. In addition, 15 
      different variants and polymorphisms of unknown functional significance were found. 
      The high incidence of new and individual A-T mutations in our cohort of patients 
      demonstrates marked mutational heterogeneity of A-T in Italy and corroborate the 
      efficiency of DHPLC as a method for the mutation screening of A-T patients.

TI  - Very mild presentation in adult with classical cellular phenotype of ataxia 
      telangiectasia.
PG  - 524-8
LID - 10.1002/mds.25236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The major clinical feature of ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is severe 
      progressive neurodegeneration with onset in infancy. This classical A-T phenotype is 
      caused by biallelic null mutations in the ATM gene, leading to the absence of ATM 
      protein and increased cellular radiosensitivity. We report an unusual case of A-T in 
      a 41-year-old mother, A-T210, who had very mild neurological symptoms despite 
      complete loss of ATM protein. METHODS: A neurological examination was performed, 
      cellular radiosensitivity was assessed, and the ATM gene was sequenced. Skin 
      fibroblasts and a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) were assayed for ATM protein 
      expression and kinase activity. RESULTS: Patient A-T210 showed mild chorea, 
      dystonia, and gait ataxia, walked independently, and drove a car. LCL and skin 
      fibroblasts were radiosensitive and did not express ATM protein. Two ATM-null 
      mutations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The severe neurodegeneration resulting from 
      loss of ATM can be mitigated in some circumstances.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare multisystem neurodegenerative genetic disorder due 
      to mutation of ATM gene. The clinical expression and the immunological abnormalities 
      are variable and apparently not associated with the type of ATM mutations. We report 
      on two siblings affected by A-T with different clinical and immunological 
      presentations; in particular in one the immunological phenotype was reminiscent of 
      hyper IgM syndrome.

AB  - A-T is a prototype genome instability syndrome and a multifaceted disease. A-T leads 
      to neurodegeneration - primarily cerebellar atrophy, immunodeficiency, 
      oculocutaneous telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels), vestigial thymus and gonads, 
      endocrine abnormalities, cancer predisposition and varying sensitivity to DNA 
      damaging agents, particularly those that induce DNA double-strand breaks. With the 
      recent increase in life expectancy of A-T patients, the premature ageing component 
      of this disease is gaining greater awareness. The complex A-T phenotype reflects the 
      ever growing number of functions assigned to the protein encoded by the responsible 
      gene - the homeostatic protein kinase, ATM. The quest to thoroughly understand the 
      complex A-T phenotype may reveal yet elusive ATM functions.

TI  - Ataxia-telangiectasia, cancer and the pathobiology of the ATM gene.
PG  - 289-304
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a pleiotropic inherited disease characterized by 
      neurodegeneration, cancer, immunodeficiencies, radiation sensitivity, and genetic 
      instability. Although A-T homozygotes are rare, the A-T gene may play a role in 
      sporadic breast cancer and leukemia. ATM, the gene responsible for A-T, is 
      homologous to several cell cycle checkpoint genes from other organisms. ATM is 
      thought to play a crucial role in a signal transduction network that modulates cell 
      cycle checkpoints, genetic recombination, apoptosis, and other cellular responses to 
      DNA damage. New insights into the pathobiology of A-T have been provided by the 
      creation of Atm-/- mice and by in vitro studies of ATM function. Analyses of ATM 
      mutations in A-T patients and in sporadic tumors suggest the existence of two 
      classes of ATM mutation: null mutations that lead to A-T and dominant negative 
      missense mutations that may predispose to cancer in the heterozygous state.

AB  - Human genomic instability syndromes affect the nervous system to different degrees 
      of severity, attesting to the vulnerability of the CNS to perturbations of genomic 
      integrity and the DNA damage response (DDR). Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a 
      typical genomic instability syndrome whose major characteristic is progressive 
      neuronal degeneration but is also associated with immunodeficiency, cancer 
      predisposition and acute sensitivity to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic 
      chemicals. A-T is caused by loss or inactivation of the ATM protein kinase, which 
      mobilizes the complex, multi-branched cellular response to double strand breaks in 
      the DNA by phosphorylating numerous DDR players. The link between ATM's function in 
      the DDR and the neuronal demise in A-T has been questioned in the past. However, 
      recent studies of the ATM-mediated DDR in neurons suggest that the neurological 
      phenotype in A-T is indeed caused by deficiency in this function, similar to other 
      features of the disease. Still, major issues concerning this phenotype remain open, 
      including the presumed differences between the DDR in post-mitotic neurons and 
      proliferating cells, the nature of the damage that accumulates in the DNA of 
      ATM-deficient neurons under normal life conditions, the mode of death of 
      ATM-deficient neurons, and the lack of a major neuronal phenotype in the mouse model 
      of A-T. A-T remains a prototype disease for the study of the DDR's role in CNS 
      development and maintenance.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by 
      mutational inactivation of the ATM gene. It is a multisystemic disease, 
      characterized by progressive neurological dysfunction, especially in the cerebellum, 
      oculo-cutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, recurrent sino-pulmonary 
      infections and high incidence of neoplasms. The responsible gene, ATM, encodes a 
      large protein that belongs to a family of protein kinases with a 
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pi3K) domain. ATM is a key regulator of cell cycle 
      checkpoints that causes DNA repair or apoptosis. Several studies report ATM function 
      in target cells (such as neurons, fibroblast, endothelium, germ cells, lymphocytes). 
      The pleiotropic phenotypes of AT reflect the multifaceted activities of ATM protein. 
      In nucleus (lymphocytes, fibroblasts, germ cells) ATM is involved in regulation of 
      cell-cycle checkpoints; in cytoplasm ATM regulates redox state (neurons).

PG  - 23-9
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia is one of a group of recessive hereditary genomic instability 
      disorders and is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency 
      and cancer susceptibility. Heterozygotes for the mutated gene are more susceptible 
      to cancer and to ischaemic heart disease. The affected gene, ATM (ataxia 
      telangiectasia mutated), has been cloned and codes for a protein kinase (ATM), which 
      orchestrates the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks after ionising 
      radiation. An underlying feature of ataxia telangiectasia is oxidative stress and 
      there is chronic activation of stress response pathways in tissues showing pathology 
      such as the cerebellum, but not in the cerebrum or liver. ATM has also been shown to 
      be activated by insulin and to have a wider role in signal transduction and cell 
      growth. Many, but not all, aspects of the phenotype can be attributed to a defective 
      DNA damage response. The oxidative stress may result directly from accumulated DNA 
      damage in affected tissues or ATM may have an additional role in sensing/modulating 
      redox homeostasis. The basis for the observed tissue specificity of the oxidative 
      damage in ataxia telangiectasia is not clear.

TI  - ATM prevents unattended DNA double strand breaks on site and in generations to come.
PG  - 1837-9
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a disorder characterized by cerebellar degeneration, 
      immunodeficiency, genomic instability and genetic predisposition to lymphoid 
      malignancies with translocations involving antigen receptor loci. The Ataxia 
      Telangiectasia Mutated gene encodes the ATM kinase, a central transducer of DNA 
      damage signals. Until recently, the etiology of the lymphoid phenotype in A-T 
      patients and the mechanisms by which ATM ensures normal repair of DNA double strand 
      break (DSB) intermediates during antigen receptor diversification reactions remained 
      poorly understood. Last year, Bredemeyer et al. (Nature 2006; 442:466-70) 
      demonstrated that ATM stabilizes chromosomal V(D)J recombination DSB intermediates, 
      facilitates DNA end joining and prevents broken DNA ends from participating in 
      chromosome deletions, inversions and translocations. A more recent study by Callen 
      et al. (Cell 2007; 130:63-75) highlighted the importance of ATM-mediated checkpoints 
      in blocking the long-term persistence and transmission of un-repaired DSBs in 
      developing lymphocytes. Collectively, these results have provided complementary 
      mechanistic insights into ATM functions in V(D)J recombination that can account for 
      the lymphoid tumor-prone phenotype associated with A-T.

TI  - Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) as a central regulator of 
      radiation-induced DNA damage response.
PG  - 13-7
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) is a DNA damage-inducible protein kinase, 
      which phosphorylates plethora of substrates participating in DNA damage response. 
      ATM significance for the cell faith is undeniable, since it regulates DNA repair, 
      cell-cycle progress, and apoptosis. Here we describe its main signalling targets and 
      discuss its importance in DNA repair as well as novel findings linked to this key 
      regulatory enzyme in the terms of ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage.

AB  - The gene that is mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), ATM, is catalytically 
      activated in response to DNA damage. Yet a full accounting for the CNS deficits in 
      human A-T or its mouse models remains elusive. We have analyzed the CNS phenotypes 
      of two mouse Atm alleles--Atm(tm1Bal) (Bal) and Atm(tm1Awb) (Awb). Neither mutant 
      has detectable mRNA or protein in peripheral tissues. In brain, although Bal/Bal 
      mice have no ATM protein, they have nearly normal amounts of Atm mRNA. Bal/Bal 
      neurons exhibit extensive cell cycle reentry and degeneration in both cortex and 
      cerebellum. Unexpectedly, in Awb/Awb mice a novel mRNA is found in which the 
      engineered mutation is excised. This mRNA is apparently translated and produces a 
      catalytically active ATM protein that responds to DNA damage by phosphorylating p53 
      and Chk2. Prompted by these results, we examined eight cases of human A-T and found 
      evidence for residual ATM protein in seven of them. These findings offer important 
      new insights into the human disease and the role of brain ATM activity in the 
      severity of the neurological symptoms of A-T.

TI  - ATM mutations, haplotype analysis, and immunological status of Russian patients with 
      ataxia telangiectasia.
PG  - 593
AB  - Mutations in the ATM gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder, 
      ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). Mutations in different ethnic groups are distributed 
      along the entire length of the large, 66 exon ATM gene. In this study, A-T patients 
      from 16 Russian families were assessed for immunological status and ATM haplotype 
      analysis, and screened for ATM mutations. Haplotype analysis was performed to 
      enhance the efficiency of mutation detection. Mutations predicted to cause disease 
      were identified in 19 of 32 alleles (59%), including a truncating mutation 
      (c.5932G>T) that was identified in 8/32 (25%) alleles both by haplotype analysis and 
      mutation screening. This mutation has been found in low abundance in other European 
      A-T cohorts suggesting that this founder-effect mutation may be of Russian origin. 
      The abundance of this mutation may allow for large-scale screening of cancer 
      patients to help clarify the role of ATM in breast and other cancers. Nine of the 
      remaining mutations were previously unreported, and add to the multitude of unique 
      mutations found throughout the gene.

TI  - ATM: the protein encoded by the gene mutated in the radiosensitive syndrome 
      ataxia-telangiectasia.
PG  - 1201-14
AB  - PURPOSE: To provide an update on the product of the ATM gene mutated in the human 
      genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). SUMMARY: The product of the ATM gene 
      mutated in the human genetic disorder A-T is a 350 kDa protein that plays a central 
      role in the regulation of a number of cellular processes. It is a member of the 
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase superfamily, but is more likely a protein kinase 
      similar to another member of that family, i.e. DNA-dependent protein kinase 
      (DNA-PK). A-T cells and fibroblasts derived from the atm -/- mouse are 
      hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and defective in cell cycle checkpoint control. 
      At present the nature of the lesion in damaged DNA recognized by ATM remains 
      uncertain, but it is evident that a small number of residual strand breaks remain 
      unrepaired in A-T cells, which may well account for the radiosensitivity. On the 
      other hand, considerable progress has been achieved in delineating the role of ATM 
      in cell cycle checkpoint control. Defects are observed at all cell cycle checkpoints 
      in A-T cells post-irradiation. At the G1 /S interface ATM has been shown to play a 
      central role in radiation-induced activation of the tumour suppressor gene product 
      p53. ATM binds to p53 in a complex fashion and activates the molecule in response to 
      breaks in DNA by phosphorylating it at serine 15 close to the N-terminus and by 
      controlling other phosphorylation and dephosphorylation changes on the molecule. 
      This in turn leads to the induction of p21/WAF1 and other p53 effector proteins 
      before inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity and G1 arrest. Emerging 
      evidence supports a direct role for ATM at other cell cycle checkpoints. Other 
      proteins interacting with ATM include c-Abl a protein tyrosine kinase, beta-adaptin 
      an endosomal protein and p21 a downstream effector of p53. The significance of these 
      interactions is currently being investigated. ATM also plays an important role in 
      the regulation and surveillance of meiotic progression. The localization of ATM to 
      both the nucleus and other subcellular organelles implicates this molecule in a 
      myriad of cellular processes. CONCLUSION: ATM is involved in DNA damage recognition 
      and cell cycle control in response to ionizing radiation damage. There is evidence 
      that ATM may also have a more general signalling role.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare genetic disease caused by germline 
      biallelic mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) that result in 
      partial or complete loss of ATM expression or activity. The course of the disease is 
      characterized by neurologic manifestations, infections, and cancers. OBJECTIVE: We 
      studied A-T progression and investigated whether manifestations were associated with 
      the ATM genotype. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in France of 
      240 patients with A-T born from 1954 to 2005 and analyzed ATM mutations in 184 
      patients, along with neurologic manifestations, infections, and cancers. RESULTS: 
      Among patients with A-T, the Kaplan-Meier 20-year survival rate was 53.4%; the 
      prognosis for these patients has not changed since 1954. Life expectancy was lower 
      among patients with mutations in ATM that caused total loss of expression or 
      function of the gene product (null mutations) compared with that seen in patients 
      with hypomorphic mutations because of earlier onset of cancer (mainly hematologic 
      malignancies). Cancer (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5) and respiratory tract 
      infections (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8) were independently associated with 
      mortality. Cancer (hazard ratio, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.9-11.6) was a major risk factor for 
      mortality among patients with null mutations, whereas respiratory tract infections 
      (hazard ratio, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.8-9.1) were the leading cause of death among patients 
      with hypomorphic mutations. CONCLUSION: Morbidity and mortality among patients with 
      A-T are associated with ATM genotype. This information could improve our prognostic 
      ability and lead to adapted therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Newborn screening for SCID identifies patients with ataxia telangiectasia.
PG  - 540-9
LID - 10.1007/s10875-012-9846-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterized by failure of T 
      lymphocyte development and absent or very low T cell receptor excision circles 
      (TRECs), DNA byproducts of T cell maturation. Newborn screening for TRECs to 
      identify SCID is now performed in several states using PCR of DNA from universally 
      collected dried blood spots (DBS). In addition to infants with typical SCID, TREC 
      screening identifies infants with T lymphocytopenia who appear healthy and in whom a 
      SCID diagnosis cannot be confirmed. Deep sequencing was employed to find causes of T 
      lymphocytopenia in such infants. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing and analysis were 
      performed in infants and their parents. Upon finding deleterious mutations in the 
      ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene, we confirmed the diagnosis of ataxia 
      telangiectasia (AT) in two infants and then tested archival newborn DBS of 
      additional AT patients for TREC copy number. RESULTS: Exome sequencing and analysis 
      led to 2 unsuspected gene diagnoses of AT. Of 13 older AT patients for whom newborn 
      DBS had been stored, 7 samples tested positive for SCID under the criteria of 
      California's newborn screening program. AT children with low neonatal TRECs had low 
      CD4 T cell counts subsequently detected (R = 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: T lymphocytopenia 
      in newborns can be a feature of AT, as revealed by TREC screening and exome 
      sequencing. Although there is no current cure for the progressive neurological 
      impairment of AT, early detection permits avoidance of infectious complications, 
      while providing information for families regarding reproductive recurrence risks and 
      increased cancer risks in patients and carriers.

TI  - ATM-dependent phosphorylation of nibrin in response to radiation exposure.
PG  - 115-9
AB  - Mutations in the gene ATM are responsible for the genetic disorder 
      ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), which is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction, 
      radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition. Both the A-T 
      phenotype and the similarity of the ATM protein to other DNA-damage sensors suggests 
      a role for ATM in biochemical pathways involved in the recognition, signalling and 
      repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). There are strong parallels between the 
      pattern of radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition in 
      A-T patients and that in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). The protein 
      defective in NBS, nibrin (encoded by NBS1), forms a complex with MRE11 and RAD50 
      (refs 1,2). This complex localizes to DSBs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure 
      to ionizing radiation (IR) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a 
      longer period of time. The overlap between clinical and cellular phenotypes in A-T 
      and NBS suggests that ATM and nibrin may function in the same biochemical pathway. 
      Here we demonstrate that nibrin is phosphorylated within one hour of treatment of 
      cells with IR. This response is abrogated in A-T cells that either do not express 
      ATM protein or express near full-length mutant protein. We also show that ATM 
      physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and 
      in vitro. Phosphorylation of this site appears to be functionally important because 
      mutated nibrin (S343A) does not completely complement radiosensitivity in NBS cells. 
      ATM phosphorylation of nibrin does not affect nibrin-MRE11-RAD50 association as 
      revealed by radiation-induced foci formation. Our data provide a biochemical 
      explanation for the similarity in phenotype between A-T and NBS.

TI  - Ataxia telangiectasia gene mutations in leukaemia and lymphoma.
PG  - 512-6
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare multisystem, autosomal, recessive disease 
      characterised by neuronal degeneration, genome instability, and an increased risk of 
      cancer. Approximately 10% of AT homozygotes develop cancer, mostly of the lymphoid 
      system. Lymphoid malignancies in patients with AT are of both B cell and T cell 
      origin, and include Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and several forms of 
      leukaemia. The AT locus was mapped to the chromosomal region 11q22-23 using genetic 
      linkage analysis in the late 1980s and the causative gene was identified by 
      positional cloning several years later. The ATM gene encodes a large protein that 
      belongs to a family of kinases possessing a highly conserved C-terminal kinase 
      domain related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain. Members of this kinase 
      family have been shown to function in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control 
      following DNA damage. Recent studies indicate that ATM is activated primarily in 
      response to double strand breaks and may be considered a caretaker of the genome. 
      Most mutations in ATM result in truncation and destabilisation of the protein, but 
      certain missense and splicing errors have been shown to produce a less severe 
      phenotype. AT heterozygotes have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. Atm 
      deficient mice exhibit many of the symptoms found in patients with AT and have a 
      high frequency of thymic lymphoma. The association between mutation of the ATM gene 
      and a high incidence of lymphoid malignancy in patients with AT, together with the 
      development of lymphoma in Atm deficient mice, supports the proposal that 
      inactivation of the ATM gene may be of importance in the pathogenesis of sporadic 
      lymphoid malignancy. Loss of heterozygosity at 11q22-23 (the location of the ATM 
      gene) is a common event in lymphoid malignancy. Frequent inactivating mutations of 
      the ATM gene have been reported in patients with rare sporadic T cell prolymphocytic 
      leukaemia (T-PLL), B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), and most recently, 
      mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in AT, the most 
      frequent nucleotide changes in these sporadic lymphoid malignancies were missense 
      mutations. The presence of inactivating mutations, together with the deletion of the 
      normal copy of the ATM gene in some patients with T-PLL, B-CLL, and MCL, establishes 
      somatic inactivation of the ATM gene in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies, 
      and strongly suggests that ATM functions as a tumour suppressor. The presence of 
      missense mutations in the germline of patients with B-CLL has been reported, 
      suggesting that some patients with B-CLL may be constitutional AT heterozygotes. The 
      putative hereditary predisposition of B-CLL, although intriguing, warrants further 
      investigation.

TI  - Bone marrow transplantation improves the outcome of Atm-deficient mice through the 
      migration of ATM-competent cells.
PG  - 493-507
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds448 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a highly pleiotropic disorder. Patients suffer from 
      progressive neurodegeneration, severe bronchial complications, immunodeficiency, 
      hypersensitivity to radiotherapy and elevated risk of malignancies. Leukemia and 
      lymphoma, along with lung failure, are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in 
      A-T patients. At present, no effective therapy for A-T exists. One promising 
      therapeutic approach is bone marrow transplantation (BMT) that is already used as a 
      curative therapy for other genomic instability syndromes. We used an established 
      clinically relevant non-myeloablative host-conditioning regimen and transplanted 
      green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing ataxia telangiectasia mutated 
      (ATM)-competent bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) into Atm-deficient mice. GFP 
      expression allowed tracking of the potential migration of the cells into the tissues 
      of recipient animals. Donor BMDCs migrated into the bone marrow, blood, thymus, 
      spleen and lung tissue of Atm-deficient mice showing an ATM-competent phenotype. BMT 
      inhibited thymic lymphomas, normalized T-lymphocyte populations, improved weight 
      gain and rearing activity of Atm-deficient mice. In contrast, no GFP(+) cells were 
      found in the cerebellum or cerebrum, and we detected decreased size index in MRI 
      imaging of the cerebellum in 8-month-old transplanted Atm-deficient mice in 
      comparison to wild-type mice. The repopulation with ATM-competent BMDCs is 
      associated with a prolonged lifespan and significantly improved the phenotype of 
      Atm-deficient mice.

TI  - Ataxia telangiectasia: more variation at clinical and cellular levels.
PG  - 199-208
LID - 10.1111/cge.12453 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare recessively inherited disorder resulting in a 
      progressive neurological decline. It is caused by biallelic mutation of the ATM gene 
      that encodes a 370 kDa serine/threonine protein kinase responsible for 
      phosphorylating many target proteins. ATM is activated by auto(trans)phosphorylation 
      in response to DNA double strand breaks and leads to the activation of cell cycle 
      checkpoints and either DNA repair or apoptosis as part of the cellular response to 
      DNA damage. The allelic heterogeneity in A-T is striking. While the majority of 
      mutations are truncating, leading to instability and loss of the ATM protein from 
      the allele, a significant proportion of patients carry one of a small number of 
      mutations that are either missense or leaky splice site mutations resulting in 
      retention of some ATM with activity. The allelic heterogeneity in ATM, therefore, 
      results in an equally striking clinical heterogeneity. There is also locus 
      heterogeneity because mutation of the MRE11 gene can cause an obvious A-T like 
      disorder both clinically and also at the cellular level and mutation of the RNF168 
      gene results in a much milder clinical phenotype, neurologically, with the major 
      clinical feature being an immunological defect.

TI  - Cancer risks and mortality in heterozygous ATM mutation carriers.
PG  - 813-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ATM gene are the 
      principal cause of ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). Several studies have suggested that 
      heterozygous carriers of ATM mutations are at increased risk of breast cancer and 
      perhaps of other cancers, but the precise risk is uncertain. METHODS: Cancer 
      incidence and mortality information for 1160 relatives of 169 UK A-T patients 
      (including 247 obligate carriers) was obtained through the National Health Service 
      Central Registry. Relative risks (RRs) of cancer in carriers, allowing for genotype 
      uncertainty, were estimated with a maximum-likelihood approach that used the EM 
      algorithm. Maximum-likelihood estimates of cancer risks associated with three groups 
      of mutations were calculated using the pedigree analysis program MENDEL. All 
      statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The overall relative risk of breast 
      cancer in carriers was 2.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16 to 4.28) compared 
      with the general population but was 4.94 (95% CI = 1.90 to 12.9) in those younger 
      than age 50 years. The relative risk for all cancers other than breast cancer was 
      2.05 (95% CI = 1.09 to 3.84) in female carriers and 1.23 (95% CI = 0.76 to 2.00) in 
      male carriers. Breast cancer was the only site for which a clear risk increase was 
      seen, although there was some evidence of excess risks of colorectal cancer (RR = 
      2.54, 95% CI = 1.06 to 6.09) and stomach cancer (RR = 3.39, 95% CI = 0.86 to 13.4). 
      Carriers of mutations predicted to encode a full-length ATM protein had cancer risks 
      similar to those of people carrying truncating mutations. CONCLUSION: These results 
      confirm a moderate risk of breast cancer in A-T heterozygotes and give some evidence 
      of an excess risk of other cancers but provide no support for large 
      mutation-specific differences in risk.

TI  - Ophthalmic features of ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder.
PG  - 186-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a recessive neurodegenerative disease 
      due to a faulty repair mechanism for breaks in double-stranded DNA (ATM mutation). 
      Ophthalmic features of AT include conjunctival telangiectasia, strabismus, saccadic 
      dysfunction with head thrusts, and convergence insufficiency. Ataxia 
      telangiectasia-like syndrome (ATLD) is a more recently recognized condition due to 
      homozygous mutation in MRE11, a gene also involved in the cellular repair response 
      to double-stranded DNA breaks; ophthalmic features of ATLD are not well described. 
      The purpose of this article is to describe the ophthalmic features of ATLD. METHODS: 
      Full ophthalmologic and orthoptic evaluations were obtained in 13 individuals: 10 
      previously reported ATLD patients, an additional related ATLD patient, and 3 
      nonaffected relatives. All individuals were from three unrelated consanguineous 
      Saudi Arabian families harboring an MRE11 mutation (W210C). Age range was from 2 to 
      40 years of age. RESULTS: No affected patient had structural ocular abnormality (eg, 
      conjunctival telangiectasia), manifest strabismus at distance, or duction 
      limitation. All but one (the youngest) had saccadic dysfunction (without head 
      thrusts). Most patients had abnormal convergence. Older patients had nystagmus with 
      abnormalities in smooth pursuit and vestibular ocular reflex. All patients had 
      cerebellar atrophy by neuroimaging and slowly progressive ataxia. The unaffected 
      heterozygous relatives had unremarkable ophthalmic and neurologic examinations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Saccadic dysfunction without head thrusts and convergence abnormality 
      are common in ATLD secondary to homozygous W210C MRE11 mutation. Older patients have 
      nystagmus with abnormalities in smooth pursuit and vestibular ocular reflex. Eye 
      movement control systems apparently deteriorate with time in this rare neurological 
      disease. Ophthalmic features of AT that were not observed in any of our ATLD 
      patients include conjunctival telangiectasia, head thrusting, and manifest 
      strabismus at distance.

TI  - ATM stabilizes DNA double-strand-break complexes during V(D)J recombination.
PG  - 466-70
AB  - The ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) protein kinase mediates early cellular 
      responses to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated during metabolic processes or 
      by DNA-damaging agents. ATM deficiency leads to ataxia-telangiectasia, a disease 
      marked by lymphopenia, genomic instability and an increased predisposition to 
      lymphoid malignancies with chromosomal translocations involving lymphocyte antigen 
      receptor loci. ATM activates cell-cycle checkpoints and can induce apoptosis in 
      response to DNA DSBs. However, defects in these pathways of the DNA damage response 
      cannot fully account for the phenotypes of ATM deficiency. Here, we show that ATM 
      also functions directly in the repair of chromosomal DNA DSBs by maintaining DNA 
      ends in repair complexes generated during lymphocyte antigen receptor gene assembly. 
      When coupled with the cell-cycle checkpoint and pro-apoptotic activities of ATM, 
      these findings provide a molecular explanation for the increase in lymphoid tumours 
      with translocations involving antigen receptor loci associated with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia.

TI  - Improved diagnostic testing for ataxia-telangiectasia by immunoblotting of nuclear 
      lysates for ATM protein expression.
PG  - 437-43
AB  - The laboratory diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) currently relies upon 
      measurement of serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) and cellular sensitivity to ionizing 
      radiation. A previous report suggests that immunoblotting of whole cell lysates from 
      lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) might be informative for diagnosis. To further 
      evaluate this possibility, and improve sensitivity, we performed immunoblotting for 
      ATM protein on nuclear lysates of 71 consecutive radiosensitive LCLs that were 
      established from patients with clinical features suggestive of A-T. Fifty-two LCLs 
      (73%) contained no detectable ATM protein, with a representative sample (N=25) 
      testing negative for ATM kinase activity, having at least one ATM mutation, and 
      having elevated AFP levels; these results confirmed the diagnosis. Seventeen LCLs 
      (24%) expressed intermediate or normal levels of ATM protein and exhibited normal 
      ATM kinase activity; follow-up studies failed to detect ATM mutations and AFP levels 
      were normal in all but three. Of the remaining two radiosensitive LCLs, one had 35% 
      of normal protein with normal kinase activity and no ATM mutations. The other LCL 
      had 9% of normal protein, with intermediate levels of kinase activity, a homozygous 
      missense ATM mutation, and elevated AFP. Our data suggest that it is very uncommon 
      to encounter bonafide A-T patients with more than trace amounts of ATM protein. We 
      conclude that immunoblotting for ATM protein is of higher specificity for diagnosing 
      A-T than radiosensitivity testing. In addition, we have documented in vitro 
      radiosensitivity in other patients who share some clinical features with A-T.

AB  - Appropriate cellular signaling responses to DNA damage and the ability to repair DNA 
      are fundamental processes that are required for organismal survival. 
      Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare neurodegenerative disease that results from 
      defective DNA damage signaling. Understanding the molecular basis of A-T has 
      provided many critical insights into the cellular response to DNA double-strand 
      breaks (DSBs). A-T is a syndrome that shows pronounced neurodegeneration of the 
      nervous system coincident with immune deficiency, radiosensitivity, and cancer 
      proneness. A-T results from inactivation of the A-T mutated (ATM) kinase, a critical 
      protein kinase that regulates the response to DNA-DSBs by selective phosphorylation 
      of a variety of substrates. Therefore, understanding the ATM signaling program has 
      important biological ramifications for nervous system homeostasis. Underscoring the 
      importance of the DNA-DSBs response in the nervous system are other diseases related 
      to A-T that also result from defects in this signaling pathway. In particular, 
      defects in the DNA damage sensor, the Mre11-RAD50-NBS1 complex, also lead to 
      syndromes with neurological deficits and overlapping phenotypes to A-T. 
      Collectively, these diseases highlight the critical importance of appropriate 
      responses to DNA-DSBs to maintain homeostasis in the nervous system.

AB  - Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that 
      dephosphorylates proteins in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-initiated DNA 
      damage response pathway. WIP1 may have a homeostatic role in ATM signaling by 
      returning the cell to a normal pre-stress state following completion of DNA repair. 
      To better understand the effects of WIP1 on ATM signaling, we crossed Atm-deficient 
      mice to Wip1-deficient mice and characterized phenotypes of the double knockout 
      progeny. We hypothesized that the absence of Wip1 might rescue Atm deficiency 
      phenotypes. Atm null mice, like ATM-deficient humans with the inherited syndrome 
      ataxia telangiectasia, exhibit radiation sensitivity, fertility defects, and are 
      T-cell lymphoma prone. Most double knockout mice were largely protected from 
      lymphoma development and had a greatly extended lifespan compared with Atm null 
      mice. Double knockout mice had increased p53 and H2AX phosphorylation and p21 
      expression compared with their Atm null counterparts, indicating enhanced p53 and 
      DNA damage responses. Additionally, double knockout splenocytes displayed reduced 
      chromosomal instability compared with Atm null mice. Finally, doubly null mice were 
      partially rescued from gametogenesis defects observed in Atm null mice. These 
      results indicate that inhibition of WIP1 may represent a useful strategy for cancer 
      treatment in general and A-T patients in particular.

TI  - ATM mutations and phenotypes in ataxia-telangiectasia families in the British Isles: 
      expression of mutant ATM and the risk of leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer.
PG  - 334-45
AB  - We report the spectrum of 59 ATM mutations observed in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) 
      patients in the British Isles. Of 51 ATM mutations identified in families native to 
      the British Isles, 11 were founder mutations, and 2 of these 11 conferred a milder 
      clinical phenotype with respect to both cerebellar degeneration and cellular 
      features. We report, in two A-T families, an ATM mutation (7271T-->G) that may be 
      associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both homozygotes and 
      heterozygotes (relative risk 12.7; P=. 0025), although there is a less severe A-T 
      phenotype in terms of the degree of cerebellar degeneration. This mutation 
      (7271T-->G) also allows expression of full-length ATM protein at a level comparable 
      with that in unaffected individuals. In addition, we have studied 18 A-T patients, 
      in 15 families, who developed leukemia, lymphoma, preleukemic T-cell proliferation, 
      or Hodgkin lymphoma, mostly in childhood. A wide variety of ATM mutation types, 
      including missense mutations and in-frame deletions, were seen in these patients. We 
      also show that 25% of all A-T patients carried in-frame deletions or missense 
      mutations, many of which were also associated with expression of mutant ATM protein.

TI  - Five haplotypes account for fifty-five percent of ATM mutations in Brazilian 
      patients with ataxia telangiectasia: seven new mutations.
PG  - 33-40
AB  - We have studied the molecular genetics of 27 Brazilian families with ataxia 
      telangiectasia (AT). Five founder effect haplotypes accounted for 55.5% of the 
      families. AT is an autosomal recessive disorder of childhood onset characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia, ocular apraxia, telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, 
      radiation sensitivity, chromosomal instability, and predisposition to cancer. The 
      ATM gene spans more than 150 kb on chromosome region 11q23.1 and encodes a product 
      of 3056 amino acids. The ATM protein is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 
      3-kinase (PI-3K) family of proteins and is involved in cell cycle control and DNA 
      repair pathways. DNA was isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines and haplotyped 
      using four STR markers (D11S1818, NS22, D11S2179, D11S1819) within and flanking the 
      ATM gene; all allele sizes were standardized in advance. In addition to the STR 
      haplotypes, SNP haplotypes were determined using 10 critical polymorphisms. The 
      entire gene was screened sequentially by protein truncation testing (PTT), single 
      strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and then denaturing high performance liquid 
      chromatography (dHPLC) to identify the disease-causing mutations. Of the expected 54 
      mutations, 50 were identified. All mutations but one, led to a truncated or null 
      form of the ATM protein (nonsense, splice site, or frameshift). Five families 
      (18.5%) carried a deletion of 3450nt (from IVS28 to Ex31), making this one of the 
      two most common Brazilian mutations. Mutations were located throughout the entire 
      gene, with no clustering or hotspots. Standardized STR haplotype analysis greatly 
      enhanced the efficiency of mutation screening.

TI  - A novel mouse model for ataxia-telangiectasia with a N-terminal mutation displays a 
      behavioral defect and a low incidence of lymphoma but no increased oxidative burden.
PG  - 6331-49
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv342 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare multi-system disorder caused by mutations in 
      the ATM gene. Significant heterogeneity exists in the underlying genetic mutations 
      and clinical phenotypes. A number of mouse models have been generated that harbor 
      mutations in the distal region of the gene, and a recent study suggests the presence 
      of residual ATM protein in the brain of one such model. These mice recapitulate many 
      of the characteristics of A-T seen in humans, with the notable exception of 
      neurodegeneration. In order to study how an N-terminal mutation affects the disease 
      phenotype, we generated an inducible Atm mutant mouse model (Atm(tm1Mmpl/tm1Mmpl), 
      referred to as A-T [M]) predicted to express only the first 62 amino acids of Atm. 
      Cells derived from A-T [M] mutant mice exhibited reduced cellular proliferation and 
      an altered DNA damage response, but surprisingly, showed no evidence of an oxidative 
      imbalance. Examination of the A-T [M] animals revealed an altered immunophenotype 
      consistent with A-T. In contrast to mice harboring C-terminal Atm mutations that 
      disproportionately develop thymic lymphomas, A-T [M] mice developed lymphoma at a 
      similar rate as human A-T patients. Morphological analyses of A-T [M] cerebella 
      revealed no substantial cellular defects, similar to other models of A-T, although 
      mice display behavioral defects consistent with cerebellar dysfunction. Overall, 
      these results suggest that loss of Atm is not necessarily associated with an 
      oxidized phenotype as has been previously proposed and that loss of ATM protein is 
      not sufficient to induce cerebellar degeneration in mice.

TI  - MRE11 mutations and impaired ATM-dependent responses in an Italian family with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder.
PG  - 2155-63
AB  - Hypomorphic mutations of the MRE11 gene are the hallmark of the radiosensitive 
      ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD). Here, we describe a new family with two 
      affected siblings, ATLD5 and ATLD6, now aged 37 and 36, respectively. They presented 
      with late onset cerebellar degeneration slowly progressing until puberty and absence 
      of telangiectasias, and were cancer-free. Both patients were wild-type for ATM and 
      NBS1, but compound heterozygotes for MRE11 gene mutations [1422C-->A, T481K; 
      1714C-->T, R571X]. The 1422C-->A allele was inherited from the mother, whereas the 
      1714C-->T, allele paternally inherited, was apparently null as a result of 
      nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Interestingly, the 1714C-->T mutation is the 
      same as previously identified in an unrelated English ATLD family (probands ATLD3 
      and ATLD4), suggesting an important role for NMD in saving potentially lethal 
      mutations. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from ATLD5 and ATLD6 were normal 
      for ATM, but defective for Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1 (the MRN complex) protein 
      expression. Their response to gamma-radiation was abnormal, as evidenced by the 
      enhanced radiosensitivity, attenuated autophosphorylation of ATM-S1981 and 
      phosphorylation of the ATM targets p53-S15 and Smc1-S966, failure to form Mre11 
      nuclear foci and defective G1 checkpoint arrest. The fibroblasts, but not LCLs, from 
      ATLD5 and ATLD6 showed an impaired ATM-dependent Chk2 phosphorylation. These 
      findings further underscore the interconnection between ATM activity and MRN 
      function, which rationalizes the clinical similarity between ataxia-telangiectasia 
      (A-T) and ATLD.

TI  - ATM deficiency disrupts Tcra locus integrity and the maturation of CD4+CD8+ 
      thymocytes.
PG  - 1887-96
AB  - Mutations in ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) cause ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), a 
      disease characterized by neurodegeneration, sterility, immunodeficiency, and T-cell 
      leukemia. Defective ATM-mediated DNA damage responses underlie many aspects of the 
      AT syndrome, but the basis for the immune deficiency has not been defined. ATM 
      associates with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and some evidence suggests that ATM 
      may regulate V(D)J recombination. However, it remains unclear how ATM loss 
      compromises lymphocyte development in vivo. Here, we show that T-cell receptor beta 
      (TCRbeta)-dependent proliferation and production of TCRbeta(low) CD4+CD8+ (DP) 
      thymocytes occurred normally in Atm-/- mice. In striking contrast, the postmitotic 
      maturation of TCRbeta(low) DP precursors into TCRbeta(int) DP cells and TCRbeta(hi) 
      mature thymocytes was profoundly impaired. Furthermore, Atm-/- thymocytes expressed 
      abnormally low amounts of TCRalpha mRNA and protein. These defects were not 
      attributable to the induction of a BCL-2-sensitive apoptotic pathway. Rather, they 
      were associated with frequent biallelic loss of distal Va gene segments in DP 
      thymocytes, revealing that ATM maintains Tcra locus integrity as it undergoes V(D)J 
      recombination. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ATM loss increases the 
      frequency of aberrant Tcra deletion events, which compromise DP thymocyte maturation 
      and likely promote the generation of oncogenic TCR translocations.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency (PID) 
      disease that is caused by mutations in ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene 
      encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase. A-T patients represent a broad range of 
      clinical manifestations including progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous 
      telangiectasia, variable immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, susceptibility to 
      malignancies, and increased metabolic diseases. This congenital disorder has 
      phenotypic heterogeneity, and the severity of symptoms varies in different patients 
      based on severity of mutations and disease progression. The principal role of 
      nuclear ATM is the coordination of cellular signaling pathways in response to DNA 
      double-strand breaks, oxidative stress, and cell cycle checkpoint. The pathogenesis 
      of A-T is not limited to the role of ATM in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, 
      and it has other functions mainly in the hematopoietic cells and neurons. ATM 
      adjusts the functions of organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes and also 
      regulates angiogenesis and glucose metabolisms. However, ATM has other functions in 
      the cells (especially cell viability) that need further investigations. In this 
      review, we described functions of ATM in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and also its 
      association with some disorder formation such as neurologic, immunologic, vascular, 
      pulmonary, metabolic, and dermatologic complications.

AB  - The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene, which is mutated in the autosomal 
      recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), was isolated in 1995 by positional 
      cloning. Although in vitro cell fusion studies had suggested that AT was genetically 
      heterogeneous, all AT patients studied to date have been found to harbor mutations 
      in the ATM gene. More that 100 ATM mutations occurring in AT patients have been 
      documented. The mutations are broadly distributed throughout the ATM gene. Except 
      for patients from families with known consanguinity, most AT patients are compound 
      heterozygotes. The majority (> 70%) of mutations are predicted to lead to protein 
      truncation. A significant number of the reported mutations affect mRNA splicing with 
      at least half of the coding exons (32/62) having been observed to undergo exon 
      skipping. The large size of the ATM gene, 66 exons spanning approximately 150 kb of 
      genomic DNA, together with the diversity and broad distribution of mutations in AT 
      patients greatly limits the utility of direct mutation screening as a diagnostic 
      tool, or method of carrier identification, except where founder effect mutations are 
      involved.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) results from inactivation of the ATM protein kinase. 
      DNA-damage signaling is a prime function of this kinase, although other roles have 
      been ascribed to ATM. Identifying the primary ATM function(s) for tissue homeostasis 
      is key to understanding how these functions contribute to the prevention of 
      A-T-related pathology. In this regard, because A-T is primarily a neurodegenerative 
      disease, it is essential to understand how ATM loss results in degenerative effects 
      on the nervous system. In addition to delineating the biochemistry and cell biology 
      of ATM, important insights into the molecular basis for neurodegeneration in A-T 
      come from a spectrum of phenotypically related neurodegenerative diseases that 
      directly result from DNA-repair deficiency. Together with A-T, these syndromes 
      indicate that neurodegeneration can be caused by the failure to appropriately 
      respond to DNA damage. This review focuses on defective DNA-damage signaling as the 
      underlying cause of A-T.

TI  - Analysis of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated-mediated DNA damage response in murine 
      cerebellar neurons.
PG  - 7767-74
AB  - The DNA damage response is a network of signaling pathways that affects many aspects 
      of cellular metabolism after the induction of DNA damage. The primary transducer of 
      the cellular response to the double-strand break, a highly cytotoxic DNA lesion, is 
      the nuclear protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) mutated (ATM), which 
      phosphorylates numerous effectors that play key roles in the damage response 
      pathways. Loss or inactivation of ATM leads to A-T, an autosomal recessive disorder 
      characterized by neuronal degeneration, particularly the loss of cerebellar granule 
      and Purkinje cells, immunodeficiency, genomic instability, radiosensitivity, and 
      cancer predisposition. The reason for the cerebellar degeneration in A-T is not 
      clear. It has been ascribed by several investigators to cytoplasmic functions of ATM 
      that may not be relevant to the DNA damage response. We set out to examine the 
      subcellular localization of ATM and characterize the ATM-mediated damage response in 
      mouse cerebellar neurons. We found that ATM is essentially nuclear in these cells 
      and that various readouts of the ATM-mediated damage response are similar to those 
      seen in commonly used cell lines. These include the autophosphorylation of ATM, 
      which marks its activation, and phosphorylation of several of its downstream 
      substrates. Importantly, all of these responses are detected in the nuclei of 
      granule and Purkinje cells, suggesting that nuclear ATM functions in these cells 
      similar to other cell types. These results support the notion that the cerebellar 
      degeneration in A-T patients results from defective DNA damage response.

      exposed to hydrogen peroxide.
PG  - 76-82
AB  - DNA is damaged in cells during cell replication, by infection, or by various 
      environmental stresses. The damaged cells stop cell cycle, repair damaged DNA, and 
      when repaired progress into the next cell cycle stage. But when the attempt to 
      repair the damage fails, the cells undergo apoptosis. The most deleterious damage of 
      all is double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), where ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) 
      serves as a sensor. The ATM pathway culminates in DNA repair through nonhomologous 
      end-joining or through homologous recombination. Upon DNA damage, the DNA repair 
      protein Ku70/80 translocates into the nucleus, which may be mediated by ATM. 
      Previously, we found that pancreatic acinar cells undergo apoptosis upon oxidative 
      stress, and the cell death stems from nuclear loss of Ku70/80. This study aims to 
      investigate whether ATM has a role in Ku activation and prevention of cell death 
      induced by oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) using A-T fibroblasts stably 
      transfected with human full-length ATM cDNA or empty vector. As a result, hydrogen 
      peroxide-induced cell death was augmented in A-T cells transfected with empty vector 
      while cell death was prevented in A-T fibroblasts stably transfected with human 
      full-length ATM cDNA. Ku DNA-binding activity induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment 
      was increased in the A-T fibroblasts stably transfected with human full-length ATM 
      cDNA compared to that in A-T cells transfected with empty vector. The results 
      suggest that ATM may be essential for Ku activation to repair DNA damage from 
      oxidative stress and prevent cell death caused by oxidative stress.

TI  - Ataxia-telangiectasia: phenotype/genotype studies of ATM protein expression, 
      mutations, and radiosensitivity.
PG  - 122-33
AB  - Previous studies on a limited number of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients with 
      detectable levels of intracellular ATM protein have suggested a genotype/phenotype 
      correlation. We sought to elucidate this possible correlation by comparing ATM 
      protein levels with mutation types, radiosensitivity, and clinical phenotype. In 
      this study, Western blot analysis was used to measure ATM protein in lysates of 
      lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 123 unrelated A-T patients, 10 A-T 
      heterozygotes, and 10 patients with phenotypes similar to A-T. Our Western blot 
      protocol can detect the presence of ATM protein in as little as 1 microg of total 
      protein; at least 25 microg of protein was tested for each individual. ATM protein 
      was absent in 105 of the 123 patients (85%); most of these patients had truncating 
      mutations. The remaining subset of 18 patients (15%) had reduced levels of 
      normal-sized ATM protein; missense mutations were more common in this subset. We 
      used a colony survival assay to characterize the phenotypic response of the LCLs to 
      radiation exposure; patients with or without detectable ATM protein were typically 
      radiosensitive. Nine of 10 A-T heterozygotes also had reduced expression of ATM, 
      indicating that both alleles contribute to ATM protein production. These data 
      suggest that although ATM-specific mRNA is abundant in A-T cells, the abnormal ATM 
      protein is unstable and is quickly targeted for degradation. We found little 
      correlation between level of ATM protein and the type of underlying mutation, the 
      clinical phenotype, or the radiophenotype.

TI  - Levels of gamma-H2AX Foci after low-dose-rate irradiation reveal a DNA DSB rejoining 
      defect in cells from human ATM heterozygotes in two at families and in another 
      apparently normal individual.
PG  - 443-53
AB  - We have investigated the use of the gamma-H2AX assay, reflecting the presence of DNA 
      double-strand breaks, as a possible means for identifying individuals who are mildly 
      hypersensitive to ionizing radiation, such as some ATM heterozygotes. We compared 
      levels of gamma-H2AX foci after irradiation in cells from six apparently normal 
      individuals as well as from individuals from two separate AT families including the 
      proband, mother, father and three unaffected siblings in each family. After a 1-Gy 
      single acute (high-dose-rate) gamma-ray dose delivered to noncycling 
      contact-inhibited monolayers of cells, clear differences were seen between samples 
      from normal individuals (ATM(+/+)) and probands (ATM(-/-)) at nearly all sampling 
      times after irradiation, but no clear distinctions were seen for cells from normal 
      compared to obligate heterozygotes (ATM(+/-)). In contrast, after 24 h of continuous 
      irradiation at a dose rate of 10 cGy/h, appreciable differences in numbers of foci 
      per cell were observed for cells from individuals for all the known ATM genotypes 
      compared with controls. Four unaffected siblings had mean numbers of foci per cell 
      similar to that for the obligate heterozygotes, whereas the other two had mean 
      values similar to that for normal controls. We determined independently that those 
      siblings with mean numbers of foci per cell in the range of ATM heterozygotes 
      carried the mutant allele, while both siblings with a normal number of foci per cell 
      after irradiation had normal alleles. A more limited set of experiments using 
      lymphoblastoid cell strains in the low-dose-rate assay also revealed distinct 
      differences for normal compared to ATM heterozygotes from the same families and 
      opens the possibility of using peripheral blood lymphocytes as a more suitable 
      material for an assay to detect mild hypersensitivities to radiation among 
      individuals.

TI  - [Syndrome of premature ageing in ataxia-telangiectasia patients].
PG  - 712-8
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), a genetic disorder due to mutation of gene atm 
      characterized by progressive neurological abnormalities in combination with 
      oculocutaneous telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, and increased frequency of 
      malignant formations, is inherited according to autosome recessive mechanism. Cells 
      of the patients with AT show increased radio sensitivity and some markers of 
      premature ageing. The telomere lengths are sharply shortened in these cells already 
      from the birth. We studied radio sensitivity (at the dose 2 Gy) and manifestations 
      of premature ageing markers in cultured skin fibroblasts obtained from two unrelated 
      AT patients and their heterozygous parents. We have shown that all the markers 
      studied, that is HP1-gamma, phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX 
      (gamma-H2AX), and focuses 53BP1, indicate premature ageing of both the patients' and 
      their blood relatives' cells. However, cells of the heterozygous carriers express 
      premature ageing to a less extent. Investigation of the repair process 
      characteristics (the amount of gamma-H2AX and the deal of cells with focuses 53BP1 
      in their nuclei) after X-ray irradiation has given following results: the patients' 
      cells complete repair only half even in 24 after irradiation, while the healthy 
      donor's cells complete repair in 24 h. Heterozygous cells also reliably differ from 
      healthy donor's cells. Only in the case of apoptosis marker, p21, heterozygous cells 
      do not differ from normal cells, whereas the patients' cells differ significantly. 
      It has been noted that the mutation of gene atm is related to suppression of DNA 
      double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair systems, which, in its turn, is in accordance 
      with the increased radio sensitivity and premature ageing at the cell level in the 
      AT families.

TI  - ATM: genome stability, neuronal development, and cancer cross paths.
PG  - 209-54
AB  - One of the cornerstones of the web of signaling pathways governing cellular life and 
      differentiation is the DNA damage response. It spans a complex network of pathways, 
      ranging from DNA repair to modulation of numerous processes in the cell. DNA 
      double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are formed as a result of genotoxic stress or 
      normal recombinational processes, are extremely lethal lesions that rapidly mobilize 
      this intricate defense system. The master controller that pilots cellular responses 
      to DSBs is the ATM protein kinase, which turns on this network by phosphorylating 
      key players in its various branches. ATM is the protein product of the gene mutated 
      in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), which is characterized by 
      neuronal degeneration, immunodeficiency, sterility, genomic instability, cancer 
      predisposition, and radiation sensitivity. The clinical and cellular phenotype of 
      A-T attests to the numerous roles of ATM, on the one hand, and to the link between 
      the DNA damage response and developmental processes on the other hand. Recent 
      studies of this protein and its effectors, combined with a thorough investigation of 
      animal models of A-T, have led to new insights into the mode of action of this 
      master controller of the DNA damage response. The evidence that ATM is involved in 
      signaling pathways other than those related to damage response, particularly ones 
      relating to cellular growth and differentiation, reinforces the multifaceted nature 
      of this protein, in which genome stability, developmental processes, and cancer 
      cross paths.

TI  - Autophosphorylation at serine 1987 is dispensable for murine Atm activation in vivo.
PG  - 222-5
AB  - The ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) protein kinase is activated under 
      physiological and pathological conditions that induce DNA double-strand breaks 
      (DSBs). Loss of ATM or failure of its activation in humans and mice lead to 
      defective cellular responses to DSBs, such as cell cycle checkpoints, radiation 
      sensitivity, immune dysfunction, infertility and cancer predisposition. A widely 
      used biological marker to identify the active form of ATM is the autophosphorylation 
      of ATM at a single, conserved serine residue (Ser 1981 in humans; Ser 1987 in 
      mouse). Here we show that Atm-dependent responses are functional at the organismal 
      and cellular level in mice that express a mutant form of Atm (mutation of Ser to Ala 
      at position 1987) as their sole Atm species. Moreover, the mutant protein does not 
      exhibit dominant-negative interfering activity when expressed physiologically or 
      overexpressed in the context of Atm heterozygous mice. These results suggest an 
      alternative mode for stimulation of Atm by DSBs in which Atm autophosphorylation at 
      Ser 1987, like trans-phosphorylation of downstream substrates, is a consequence 
      rather than a cause of Atm activation.

TI  - The NBS1-ATM connection revisited.
PG  - 2366-70
AB  - Nijmegen Breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
      characterized by microcephaly, immunodeficiency, and increased predisposition to the 
      development of malignancy. Due to the overlap of clinical and cellular features of 
      patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), NBS was described as an AT variant 
      syndrome until the underlying gene product mutation was identified. Cells from both 
      AT and NBS patients show increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR), genomic 
      instability and cell cycle checkpoint defects following DNA damage, suggesting that 
      both gene products participate in the same DNA damage response pathway. Here we 
      highlight recent developments and refinements in our understanding of the interplay 
      between NBS1 and ATM in vivo.

TI  - The genetic defect in ataxia-telangiectasia.
PG  - 177-202
AB  - The autosomal recessive human disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) was first 
      described as a separate disease entity 40 years ago. It is a multisystem disease 
      characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, 
      radiosensitivity, predisposition to lymphoid malignancies and immunodeficiency, with 
      defects in both cellular and humoral immunity. The pleiotropic nature of the 
      clinical and cellular phenotype suggests that the gene product involved is important 
      in maintaining stability of the genome but also plays a more general role in signal 
      transduction. The chromosomal instability and radiosensitivity so characteristic of 
      this disease appear to be related to defective activation of cell cycle checkpoints. 
      Greater insight into the nature of the defect in A-T has been provided by the recent 
      identification, by positional cloning, of the responsible gene, ATM. The ATM gene is 
      related to a family of genes involved in cellular responses to DNA damage and/or 
      cell cycle control. These genes encode large proteins containing a 
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain, some of which have protein kinase activity. 
      The mutations causing A-T completely inactivate or eliminate the ATM protein. This 
      protein has been detected and localized to different subcellular compartments.

TI  - Founder effects for ATM gene mutations in Italian Ataxia Telangiectasia families.
PG  - 532-9

AB  - We screened ATM gene mutations in 104 Italian Ataxia-Telangiectasia patients from 91 
      unrelated families (detection rate 90%) and found 21 recurrent mutations in 63 
      families. The majority (67%) of patients were compound heterozygotes, while 33% were 
      homozygotes. To determine the existence of common haplotypes and potential founder 
      effects, we analyzed five microsatellite markers within and flanking the ATM gene. 
      Haplotype analysis was carried out in 48/63 families harbouring 16 of the 21 
      recurrent mutations. Forty different haplotypes were detected in the 48 A-T families 
      studied. We found that the majority of patients with the same recurrent mutation 
      originated from the same geographical area. All but one recurrent mutation analyzed 
      displayed a common haplotype suggesting a single origin that then spread to 
      different geographical areas. The high number of different haplotypes does not allow 
      the screening of ATM mutations by haplotype analysis alone in the Italian 
      population. The finding of recurrent public mutations without founder effect 
      suggests the existence of 'mild' hot spots of mutation located along the sequence of 
      the ATM gene.

      ataxia-telangiectasia.
PG  - 129-47
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder 
      characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, a high risk of cancer and 
      immunodeficiency. These patients are also hypersensitive to radiotherapy. The gene 
      product defective in this syndrome, ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated), normally 
      recognizes DNA damage and signal to the DNA repair machinery and the cell cycle 
      checkpoints to minimize the risk of genetic damage. No curative strategy for this 
      disease exists. Treatment has focused on slowing the progress of the 
      neurodegeneration; devising approaches for the treatment of tumours while minimizing 
      side effects and treatment with immunoglobulin for the immunodeficiency. The most 
      debilitating feature of this disorder is the progressive neurodegeneration due to 
      loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and malfunction of other neuronal cells. 
      Correcting for the loss of Purkinje cells is technically very difficult and would 
      require transplantation of embryonic stem cells. However, since it seems likely that 
      oxidative stress may contribute to the neurodegeneration in A-T, potential therapies 
      based on the use of antioxidants offer some hope. We describe the natural course of 
      disease, some supportive therapeutic approaches already in use and those with 
      potential based on our knowledge of molecular and cellular characteristics of this 
      disorder.

TI  - ATM gene founder haplotypes and associated mutations in Polish families with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia.
PG  - 657-64
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an early onset autosomal recessive ataxia associated 
      with characteristic chromosomal aberrations, cell cycle checkpoint defects, cancer 
      susceptibility, and sensitivity to ionizing radiation. We utilized the protein 
      truncation test (PTT), and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) on cDNA, 
      as well as denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) on genomic DNA 
      (gDNA) to screen for mutations in 24 Polish A-T families. Twenty-six distinct Short 
      Tandem Repeat (STR) haplotypes were identified. Three founder mutations accounted 
      for 58% of the alleles. Three-quarters of the families had at least one recurring 
      (shared) mutation, which was somewhat surprising given the low frequency of 
      consanguinity in Poland. STR haplotyping greatly improved the efficiency of mutation 
      detection. We identified 44 of the expected 48 mutations (92%): sixty-nine percent 
      were nonsense mutations, 23% caused aberrant splicing, and 5% were missense 
      mutations. Four mutations have not been previously described. Two of the Polish 
      mutations have been observed previously in Amish and Mennonite A-T patients; this is 
      compatible with historical records. Shared mutations shared the same Single 
      Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and STR haplotypes, indicating common ancestries. The 
      Mennonite mutation, 5932 G>T, is common in Russian A-T families, and the STR 
      haplovariants are the same in both Poland and Russia. Attempts to correlate 
      phenotypes with genotypes were inconclusive due to the limited numbers of patients 
      with identical mutations.

AB  - In 1988, the gene responsible for the autosomal recessive disease ataxia- 
      telangiectasia (A-T) was localized to 11q22.3-23.1. It was eventually cloned in 
      1995. Many independent laboratories have since demonstrated that in replicating 
      cells, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is predominantly a nuclear protein that 
      is involved in the early recognition and response to double-stranded DNA breaks. ATM 
      is a high-molecular-weight PI3K-family kinase. ATM also plays many important 
      cytoplasmic roles where it phosphorylates hundreds of protein substrates that 
      activate and coordinate cell-signaling pathways involved in cell-cycle checkpoints, 
      nuclear localization, gene transcription and expression, the response to oxidative 
      stress, apoptosis, nonsense-mediated decay, and others. Appreciating these roles 
      helps to provide new insights into the diverse clinical phenotypes exhibited by A-T 
      patients-children and adults alike-which include neurodegeneration, high cancer 
      risk, adverse reactions to radiation and chemotherapy, pulmonary failure, 
      immunodeficiency, glucose transporter aberrations, insulin-resistant diabetogenic 
      responses, and distinct chromosomal and chromatin changes. An exciting recent 
      development is the ATM-dependent pathology encountered in mitochondria, leading to 
      inefficient respiration and energy metabolism and the excessive generation of free 
      radicals that themselves create life-threatening DNA lesions that must be repaired 
      within minutes to minimize individual cell losses.

TI  - Cancer risk and the ATM gene: a continuing debate.
PG  - 795-802
AB  - Deficiencies in the ability of cells to sense and repair damage in individuals with 
      rare genetic instability syndromes increase the risk of developing cancer. 
      Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), such a condition, is associated with a high incidence 
      of leukemia and lymphoma that develop in childhood. Although A-T is an autosomal 
      recessive disorder, some penetrance appears in individuals with one mutated ATM gene 
      (A-T carriers), namely, an increased risk of developing breast cancer. The gene 
      mutated in A-T, designated ATM, is homologous to several DNA damage recognition and 
      cell cycle checkpoint control genes from other organisms. Recent studies suggest 
      that ATM is activated primarily in response to double-strand breaks, the major 
      cytotoxic lesion caused by ionizing radiation, and can directly bind to and 
      phosphorylate c-Abl, p53, and replication protein A (RPA). Analysis of ATM mutations 
      in patients with A-T or with sporadic non-A-T cancers has suggested the existence of 
      two classes of ATM mutation: null mutations leading to A-T and dominant negative 
      missense mutations predisposing to cancer in the heterozygous state. Studies with 
      A-T mouse models have helped determine the basis of lymphoid tumorigenesis in A-T 
      and have shown that ATM plays a critical role in maintaining genetic stability by 
      ensuring high-fidelity execution of chromosomal events. Thus, ATM appears to act as 
      a caretaker of the genome.

TI  - A double missense mutation in the ATM gene of a Dutch family with ataxia 
      telangiectasia.
PG  - 187-91
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, elevated alpha-fetoprotein 
      levels, chromosomal instability, predisposition to cancer, and radiation 
      sensitivity. We report the identification of a new, double missense mutation in the 
      ataxia telangiectasia gene (ATM) of a Dutch family. This homozygous mutation 
      consists of two consecutive base substitutions in exon 55: a T-->G transversion at 
      position 7875 of the ATM cDNA and a G-->C transversion at position 7876. These 
      transversions were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction/primer-induced restriction 
      analysis with CelII. The double base substitution results in an amino acid change of 
      an aspartic acid to a glutamic acid at codon 2625 and of an alanine to a proline at 
      codon 2626 of the ATM protein. Both amino acids are conserved between the ATM 
      protein and its functional homolog, the Atm gene product in the mouse. Furthermore, 
      the Chou-Fasman and Robson predictions both demonstrate a change in the secondary 
      structure of the ATM protein carrying the D2625E/A2626P mutation. These findings 
      suggest that the double base substitution in the ATM gene is a disease-causing 
      mutation.

TI  - Analysis of the relationships between ATM and the Rad54 paralogs involved in 
      homologous recombination repair.
PG  - 253-61
LID - 10.1016/j.dnarep.2008.11.005 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia is a pleiotropic genomic instability disorder caused by lack 
      or inactivation of the ATM protein kinase and characterized by progressive ataxia, 
      immunodeficiency, ionizing radiation sensitivity and cancer predisposition. ATM 
      mobilizes the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks by phosphorylating key 
      players in this response. Double strand breaks are repaired by either nonhomologous 
      end-joining or homologous recombination (HR) in which the Rad54 and Rad54B paralogs 
      function. Here, we investigated the functional relationships between Atm and the 
      Rad54 proteins by constructing compound genotypes in mice. Mouse strains were 
      generated that combined inactivation of the Atm, Rad54 and Rad54B genes. All mutant 
      genotypes were viable, but obtained at sub-Mendelian ratios. Double mutants for Atm 
      and each Rad54 paralog exhibited reduced body weight and shorter lifespan, but no 
      distinct neurological phenotype. Concomitant inactivation of ATM and Rad54 did not 
      increase IR sensitivity; however, the triple Atm/Rad54/Rad54B mutant exhibited a 
      significant IR hypersensitivity compared to the other genotypes. Interestingly, 
      Atm-/- animals also exhibited hypersensitivity to the crosslinking agent mitomycin 
      C, which was increased by deficiency of either one of the Rad54 paralogs. Our 
      results reveal a differential interaction of the ATM-mediated DNA damage response 
      and Rad54 paralog-mediated HR depending on the DNA damaging agent that initiates the 
      response.

TI  - Dramatic extension of tumor latency and correction of neurobehavioral phenotype in 
      Atm-mutant mice with a nitroxide antioxidant.
PG  - 992-1000
AB  - Mutations in the ATM gene (mutated in ataxia telangiectasia) in both humans and mice 
      predispose to lymphoid tumors. A defect in this gene also causes neurodegeneration 
      in humans and a less severe neurological phenotype in mice. There is some evidence 
      that oxidative stress contributes to these defects, suggesting that antioxidants 
      could alleviate the phenotype. We demonstrate here that the antioxidant 
      5-carboxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl (CTMIO) dramatically delays the 
      onset of thymic lymphomas in Atm(-/-) mice which is not due to an enhancement of 
      apoptosis by CTMIO. We also show that this compound corrects neurobehavioral 
      deficits in these mice and reduces oxidative damage to Purkinje cells. The likely 
      mechanism of action of CTMIO is due to a reduction in oxidative stress, which is 
      protective against both the tumor progression and the development of neurological 
      abnormalities. These data suggest that antioxidant therapy has considerable 
      potential in the management of ataxia telangiectasia and possibly other 
      neurodegenerative disorders where oxidative stress is implicated.

TI  - Defective p53 response and apoptosis associated with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like 
      phenotype.
PG  - 2907-12
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), the protein defective in ataxia-telangiectasia, 
      plays a central role in DNA damage response and signaling to cell cycle checkpoints. 
      We describe here a cell line from a patient with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like 
      clinical phenotype defective in the p53 response to radiation but with normal ATM 
      activation and efficient downstream phosphorylation of other ATM substrates. No 
      mutations were detected in ATM cDNA. A normal level of interaction between p53 and 
      peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase Pin1 suggests that posttranslational modification was 
      intact in these cells but operating at reduced level. Defective p53 stabilization 
      was accompanied by defective induction of p53 effector genes and failure to induce 
      apoptosis in response to DNA-damaging agents. Continued association between p53 and 
      murine double minute-2 (Mdm2) occurred in irradiated ATL2ABR cells in response to 
      DNA damage, and incubation with Mdm2 antagonists, nutlins, increased the 
      stabilization of p53 and its transcriptional activity but failed to induce 
      apoptosis. These results suggest that ATM-dependent stabilization of p53 and 
      induction of apoptosis by radiation involve an additional factor(s) that is 
      defective in ATL2ABR cells.

TI  - Ataxia telangiectasia: a review.
PG  - 159
LID - 159
AB  - DEFINITION OF THE DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive 
      disorder primarily characterized by cerebellar degeneration, telangiectasia, 
      immunodeficiency, cancer susceptibility and radiation sensitivity. A-T is often 
      referred to as a genome instability or DNA damage response syndrome. EPIDEMIOLOGY: 
      The world-wide prevalence of A-T is estimated to be between 1 in 40,000 and 1 in 
      100,000 live births. CLINICAL DESCRIPTION: A-T is a complex disorder with 
      substantial variability in the severity of features between affected individuals, 
      and at different ages. Neurological symptoms most often first appear in early 
      childhood when children begin to sit or walk. They have immunological abnormalities 
      including immunoglobulin and antibody deficiencies and lymphopenia. People with A-T 
      have an increased predisposition for cancers, particularly of lymphoid origin. 
      Pulmonary disease and problems with feeding, swallowing and nutrition are common, 
      and there also may be dermatological and endocrine manifestations. ETIOLOGY: A-T is 
      caused by mutations in the ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia, Mutated) gene which encodes a 
      protein of the same name. The primary role of the ATM protein is coordination of 
      cellular signaling pathways in response to DNA double strand breaks, oxidative 
      stress and other genotoxic stress. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of A-T is usually 
      suspected by the combination of neurologic clinical features (ataxia, abnormal 
      control of eye movement, and postural instability) with one or more of the following 
      which may vary in their appearance: telangiectasia, frequent sinopulmonary 
      infections and specific laboratory abnormalities (e.g. IgA deficiency, lymphopenia 
      especially affecting T lymphocytes and increased alpha-fetoprotein levels). Because 
      certain neurological features may arise later, a diagnosis of A-T should be 
      carefully considered for any ataxic child with an otherwise elusive diagnosis. A 
      diagnosis of A-T can be confirmed by the finding of an absence or deficiency of the 
      ATM protein or its kinase activity in cultured cell lines, and/or identification of 
      the pathological mutations in the ATM gene. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: There are 
      several other neurologic and rare disorders that physicians must consider when 
      diagnosing A-T and that can be confused with A-T. Differentiation of these various 
      disorders is often possible with clinical features and selected laboratory tests, 
      including gene sequencing. ANTENATAL DIAGNOSIS: Antenatal diagnosis can be performed 
      if the pathological ATM mutations in that family have been identified in an affected 
      child. In the absence of identifying mutations, antenatal diagnosis can be made by 
      haplotype analysis if an unambiguous diagnosis of the affected child has been made 
      through clinical and laboratory findings and/or ATM protein analysis. GENETIC 
      COUNSELING: Genetic counseling can help family members of a patient with A-T 
      understand when genetic testing for A-T is feasible, and how the test results should 
      be interpreted. MANAGEMENT AND PROGNOSIS: Treatment of the neurologic problems 
      associated with A-T is symptomatic and supportive, as there are no treatments known 
      to slow or stop the neurodegeneration. However, other manifestations of A-T, e.g. 
      immunodeficiency, pulmonary disease, failure to thrive and diabetes can be treated 
      effectively.

TI  - Characterization of ATM gene mutations in 66 ataxia telangiectasia families.
PG  - 69-79
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by 
      neurological and immunological symptoms, radiosensitivity and cancer predisposition. 
      The gene mutated in AT, designated the ATM gene, encodes a large protein kinase with 
      a PI-3 kinase-related domain. In this study, we investigated the mutational spectrum 
      of the ATM gene in a cohort of AT patients living in Germany. We amplified and 
      sequenced all 66 exons and the flanking untranslated regions from genomic DNA of 66 
      unrelated AT patients. We identified 46 different ATM mutations and 26 sequence 
      polymorphisms and variants scattered throughout the gene. A total of 34 mutations 
      have not been described in other populations. Seven mutations occurred in more than 
      one family, but none of these accounted for more than five alleles in our patient 
      group. The majority of the mutations were truncating, confirming that the absence of 
      full-length ATM protein is the most common molecular basis of AT. Transcript 
      analyses demonstrated single exon skipping as the consequence of most splice site 
      substitutions, but a more complex pattern was observed for two mutations. Immunoblot 
      studies of cell lines carrying ATM missense substitutions or in-frame deletions 
      detected residual ATM protein in four cases. One of these mutations, a valine 
      deletion proximal to the kinase domain, resulted in ATM protein levels >20% of 
      normal in an AT lymphoblastoid cell line. In summary, our results survey and 
      characterize a plethora of variations in the ATM gene identified by exon scanning 
      sequencing and indicate a high diversity of mutations giving rise to AT in a 
      non-isolated population.

TI  - Phenotypic cellular characterization of an ataxia telangiectasia patient carrying a 
      causal homozygous missense mutation.
PG  - 169-70
AB  - Most disease-causing mutations in Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients correspond to 
      truncating mutations in the ATM gene with very few cases of AT patients carrying two 
      missense sequence alterations being reported. The cellular phenotype of a 
      lymphoblastoid cell line established from an AT patient (AT173) who showed classical 
      clinical AT features, and carried two homozygous missense alterations, the 378T>A 
      variant and 9022C>T located within the ATM kinase domain, has been characterized. 
      ATM mRNA was detectable and the ATM protein level was approximately 50% of that seen 
      in normal cell lines. Functional analysis of this protein revealed a total absence 
      of ATM kinase activity measured either in vitro or in vivo, before and after 
      exposure to ionizing radiation. The AT173 cell line was hypersensitive to ionizing 
      radiation and exhibited a G1 cell cycle arrest defect and an accumulation of cells 
      in G2 phase of the cell cycle after irradiation, a response that is identical to 
      that seen in AT cell lines carrying truncating mutations. These phenotypic features 
      strongly suggest that the 9022C>T (R3008C) missense mutation is the disease-causing 
      mutation and that the presence of ATM protein is not always predictive of a normal 
      cellular phenotype.

TI  - ATM activation by oxidative stress.
PG  - 517-21
LID - 10.1126/science.1192912 [doi]
AB  - The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase is activated by DNA 
      double-strand breaks (DSBs) through the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) DNA repair complex 
      and orchestrates signaling cascades that initiate the DNA damage response. Cells 
      lacking ATM are also hypersensitive to insults other than DSBs, particularly 
      oxidative stress. We show that oxidation of ATM directly induces ATM activation in 
      the absence of DNA DSBs and the MRN complex. The oxidized form of ATM is a 
      disulfide-cross-linked dimer, and mutation of a critical cysteine residue involved 
      in disulfide bond formation specifically blocked activation through the oxidation 
      pathway. Identification of this pathway explains observations of ATM activation 
      under conditions of oxidative stress and shows that ATM is an important sensor of 
      reactive oxygen species in human cells.

TI  - ATM mutations in Italian families with ataxia telangiectasia include two distinct 
      large genomic deletions.
PG  - 1061
AB  - In patients affected by Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), mutations in the ATM gene lead 
      to loss-of-function alleles. Nonsense, splice-site variants, small insertions or 
      deletions (frameshifts) and missense are the most commonly found mutations. Large 
      genomic deletions (LGDs) are rare (approximately 1%) but can lead to the same 
      phenotype. In compound heterozygotes, deletions are not detected by most screening 
      strategies. We analysed the ATM gene in 12 unrelated Italian A-T patients and 
      identified all 24 mutated alleles. Twelve mutations were novel. Standardized SNP and 
      STR haplotyping followed by DHPLC screening of genomic DNA, allowed all but three 
      mutations to be detected (approximately 87.5%). The remaining mutations required 
      RT-PCR analysis of ATM transcript and Southern blotting of genomic DNA. We found 
      three LGDs: one of 8.5 and two identical of 18 kb spanning exons 32-36 and 21-29, 
      respectively. The breakpoints of these deletions were sequenced in an attempt to 
      understand the mechanisms of mutations; both deletions involved regions rich in 
      repeated elements.

PG  - 7741-8
AB  - The ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) protein kinase is rapidly and specifically 
      activated in response to DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotic cells. In this 
      review, we summarize recent insights into the mechanism of ATM activation, focusing 
      on the role of the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex in this process. We also compare 
      observations of the ATM activation process in different biological systems and 
      highlight potential candidates for cellular factors that may participate in 
      regulating ATM activity in human cells.

TI  - Slow progression of ataxia-telangiectasia with double missense and in frame splice 
      mutations.
PG  - 272-7
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is caused by mutations of the ATM gene, the product of 
      which is involved in the regulation of cellular responses to radiation damage. 
      Ataxia usually starts in early childhood but a delayed age at onset and slower rate 
      of neurological deterioration has been found for some patients with variant A-T. 
      Only few patients have been documented to survive into the 4th decade. We report on 
      a patient with an attenuated form of A-T who was diagnosed as having A-T by the age 
      of 52 years and died by the age of 60 years. He was found to be a compound 
      heterozygote for a double missense mutation (D2625E and A2626P) and a novel splicing 
      mutation (496 + 5G --> A) of the ATM gene. Cytogenetic studies of the patient's 
      lymphoblastoid cells revealed modest levels of bleomycin-induced chromosomal 
      instability. Residual ATM protein was found at a level of 10-20% of wildtype. Low 
      residual ATM kinase activity could be demonstrated towards p53, whereas it was 
      poorly detectable towards nibrin. Our results corroborate the view that the clinical 
      variability of A-T is partly determined by the mutation type and indicate that A-T 
      can extend to late adulthood disease.

TI  - The innate immune response transcription factor relish is necessary for 
      neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of ataxia-telangiectasia.
PG  - 133-42
LID - 10.1534/genetics.113.150854 [doi]
AB  - Neurodegeneration is a hallmark of the human disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) 
      that is caused by mutation of the A-T mutated (ATM) gene. We have analyzed 
      Drosophila melanogaster ATM mutants to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      neurodegeneration in A-T. Previously, we found that ATM mutants upregulate the 
      expression of innate immune response (IIR) genes and undergo neurodegeneration in 
      the central nervous system. Here, we present evidence that activation of the IIR is 
      a cause of neurodegeneration in ATM mutants. Three lines of evidence indicate that 
      ATM mutations cause neurodegeneration by activating the Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) 
      transcription factor Relish, a key regulator of the Immune deficiency (Imd) IIR 
      signaling pathway. First, the level of upregulation of IIR genes, including Relish 
      target genes, was directly correlated with the level of neurodegeneration in ATM 
      mutants. Second, Relish mutations inhibited upregulation of IIR genes and 
      neurodegeneration in ATM mutants. Third, overexpression of constitutively active 
      Relish in glial cells activated the IIR and caused neurodegeneration. In contrast, 
      we found that Imd and Dif mutations did not affect neurodegeneration in ATM mutants. 
      Imd encodes an activator of Relish in the response to gram-negative bacteria, and 
      Dif encodes an immune responsive NF-κB transcription factor in the Toll signaling 
      pathway. These data indicate that the signal that causes neurodegeneration in ATM 
      mutants activates a specific NF-κB protein and does so through an unknown activator. 
      In summary, these findings suggest that neurodegeneration in human A-T is caused by 
      activation of a specific NF-κB protein in glial cells.

TI  - Altered telomere nuclear matrix interactions and nucleosomal periodicity in ataxia 
      telangiectasia cells before and after ionizing radiation treatment.
PG  - 6963-71
AB  - Cells derived from ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) patients show a prominent defect at 
      chromosome ends in the form of chromosome end-to-end associations, also known as 
      telomeric associations, seen at G(1), G(2), and metaphase. Recently, we have shown 
      that the ATM gene product, which is defective in the cancer-prone disorder A-T, 
      influences chromosome end associations and telomere length. A possible hypothesis 
      explaining these results is that the defective telomere metabolism in A-T cells are 
      due to altered interactions between the telomeres and the nuclear matrix. We 
      examined these interactions in nuclear matrix halos before and after radiation 
      treatment. A difference was observed in the ratio of soluble versus 
      matrix-associated telomeric DNA between cells derived from A-T and normal 
      individuals. Ionizing radiation treatment affected the ratio of soluble versus 
      matrix-associated telomeric DNA only in the A-T cells. To test the hypothesis that 
      the ATM gene product is involved in interactions between telomeres and the nuclear 
      matrix, we examined such interactions in human cells expressing either a 
      dominant-negative effect or complementation of the ATM gene. The phenotype of RKO 
      colorectal tumor cells expressing ATM fragments containing a leucine zipper motif 
      mimics the altered interactions of telomere and nuclear matrix similar to that of 
      A-T cells. A-T fibroblasts transfected with wild-type ATM gene had corrected 
      telomere-nuclear matrix interactions. Further, we found that A-T cells had different 
      micrococcal nuclease digestion patterns compared to normal cells before and after 
      irradiation, indicating differences in nucleosomal periodicity in telomeres. These 
      results suggest that the ATM gene influences the interactions between telomeres and 
      the nuclear matrix, and alterations in telomere chromatin could be at least partly 
      responsible for the pleiotropic phenotypes of the ATM gene.

PG  - 37-42
LID - 10.1007/s12185-012-1240-5 [doi]
AB  - The XCIND syndrome is named after distinct hypersensitivity to ionizing (X-ray) 
      irradiation, cancer susceptibility, immunodeficiency, neurological abnormality, and 
      double-strand DNA breakage. The disorders comprising XCIND syndrome are usually 
      inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is one such 
      disease, and is caused by biallelic germline mutation of the Ataxia telangiectasia 
      mutated (ATM) gene. Heterozygous carriers of the ATM mutation, who do not show 
      A-T-like clinical symptoms, are estimated to comprise 1 % of the population. Thus, 
      understanding the biological basis of XCIND, including A-T, should help shed light 
      on the pathogenesis of genetic diseases with cancer susceptibility.

TI  - Inactive Atm abrogates DSB repair in mouse cerebellum more than does Atm loss,

AB  - The genome instability syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is caused by null 
      mutations in the ATM gene, that lead to complete loss or inactivation of the gene's 
      product, the ATM protein kinase. ATM is the primary mobilizer of the cellular 
      response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) - a broad signaling network in which 
      many components are ATM targets. The major clinical feature of A-T is cerebellar 
      atrophy, characterized by relentless loss of Purkinje and granule cells. In 
      Atm-knockout (Atm-KO) mice, complete loss of Atm leads to a very mild neurological 
      phenotype, suggesting that Atm loss is not sufficient to markedly abrogate 
      cerebellar structure and function in this organism. Expression of inactive 
      ("kinase-dead") Atm (Atm(KD)) in mice leads to embryonic lethality, raising the 
      question of whether conditional expression of Atm(KD) in the murine nervous system 
      would lead to a more pronounced neurological phenotype than Atm loss. We generated 
      two mouse strains in which Atm(KD) was conditionally expressed as the sole Atm 
      species: one in the CNS and one specifically in Purkinje cells. Focusing our 
      analysis on Purkinje cells, the dynamics of DSB readouts indicated that DSB repair 
      was delayed longer in the presence of Atm(KD) compared to Atm loss. However, both 
      strains exhibited normal life span and displayed no gross cerebellar histological 
      abnormalities or significant neurological phenotype. We conclude that the presence 
      of Atm(KD) is indeed more harmful to DSB repair than Atm loss, but the murine 
      central nervous system can reasonably tolerate the extent of this DSB repair 
      impairment. Greater pressure needs to be exerted on genome stability to obtain a 
      mouse model that recapitulates the severe A-T neurological phenotype.

TI  - ATM mutations in patients with hereditary pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 41-6
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0194 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic cancers are the fourth most-common cause of cancer-related deaths in the 
      Western world, with >200,000 cases reported in 2010. Although up to 10% of these 
      cases occur in familial patterns, the hereditary basis for predisposition in the 
      vast majority of affected families is unknown. We used next-generation sequencing, 
      including whole-genome and whole-exome analyses, and identified heterozygous, 
      constitutional, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene mutations in 2 kindreds 
      with familial pancreatic cancer. Mutations segregated with disease in both kindreds 
      and tumor analysis demonstrated LOH of the wild-type allele. By using sequence 
      analysis of an additional 166 familial pancreatic cancer probands, we identified 4 
      additional patients with deleterious mutations in the ATM gene, whereas we 
      identified no deleterious mutations in 190 spouse controls (P = 0.046). When we 
      considered only the mostly severely affected families with 3 or more pancreatic 
      cancer cases, 4 deleterious mutations were found in 87 families (P = 0.009). Our 
      results indicate that inherited ATM mutations play an important role in familial 
      pancreatic cancer predisposition. SIGNIFICANCE: The genes responsible for the 
      majority of cases of familial pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are unknown. We here 
      identify ATM as a predisposition gene for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Our 
      results have important implications for the management of patients in affected 
      families and illustrate the power of genome-wide sequencing to identify the basis of 
      familial cancer syndromes.

TI  - Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in cerebella of Atm-/- mice is 
      attributable to accumulation of reactive oxygen species.
PG  - 267-72
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.01.008 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an inherited disease, the most prominent feature of 
      which is ataxia caused by degeneration of cerebellar neurons and synapses. The 
      mechanisms underlying A-T neurodegeneration are still unclear, and many factors are 
      likely to be involved. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of energy 
      balance, and research on its function in neural cells has gained momentum in the 
      last decade. The dual roles of AMPK in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration are 
      complex, and they need to be identified and characterized. Using an Atm (ataxia 
      telangiectasia mutated) gene deficient mouse model, we showed here that: (a) 
      upregulation of AMPK phosphorylation and elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      coordinately occur in the cerebella of Atm-/- mice; (b) hydrogen peroxide induces 
      AMPK phosphorylation in primary mouse cerebellar astrocytes in an Atm-independent 
      manner; (c) administration of the novel antioxidant monosodium luminol (MSL) to 
      Atm-/- mice attenuates the upregulation of both phosphorylated-AMPK (p-AMPK) and 
      ROS, and corrects the neuromotor deficits in these animals. Together, our results 
      suggest that oxidative activation of AMPK in the cerebellum may contribute to the 
      neurodegeneration in Atm-/- mice, and that ROS and AMPK signaling pathways are 
      promising therapeutic targets for treatment of A-T and other neurodegenerative 
      diseases.

TI  - A rapid flow cytometry test based on histone H2AX phosphorylation for the sensitive 
      and specific diagnosis of ataxia telangiectasia.
PG  - 508-16
LID - 10.1002/cyto.a.20566 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with onset in 
      early childhood, caused by mutations in the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) 
      gene. Diagnosis relies on laboratory tests showing high levels of serum 
      alphafetoprotein, cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and absence or reduced 
      levels of ATM protein. Many tests, however, are not sufficiently sensitive or 
      specific for A-T, have long turnaround times, or require large blood samples. This 
      prompted us to develop a new flow cytometry method for the diagnosis of A-T based on 
      the measurement of histone H2AX phosphorylation. We established normal ranges of 
      histone H2AX phosphorylation after 2 Gy IR by testing T-cell lines, lymphoblastoid 
      cell lines (LCLs) and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or both from 20 
      genetically proven A-T and 46 control donors. To further evaluate the specificity 
      and sensitivity of the test, we analyzed cells from 19 patients suspected of having 
      A-T, and from one Friedreich Ataxia, one Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia type 2, and 
      one Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome patients. Phosphorylated histone H2AX mean 
      fluorescence intensity of irradiated A-T cells was significantly lower than that of 
      healthy donors. The intrastaining, intraassay, and interassay imprecisions were 
      <or=13.22%. Sensitivity and specificity were virtually 100% when the test was 
      performed on PBMCs. Screening of 19 consecutive new patients with suspected A-T 
      classified 15 patients as non-A-T and four as A-T; diagnosis of the latter four was 
      subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing to identify ATM mutations. The Friedreich 
      Ataxia patient, the Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia type 2 patient and the Nijmegen 
      Breakage Syndrome patient were classified as non-A-T. This flow cytometry test is 
      very sensitive, specific and rapid, and requires only 2 ml of blood. It may thus be 
      proposed for the early differential diagnosis of A-T as an alternative to methods 
      requiring the production of LCLs.

TI  - Association of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene mutation/deletion with 
      rhabdomyosarcoma.
PG  - 87-91
AB  - Rhabdomyosarcoma is a common malignancy in children. There are two major types of 
      rhabdomyosarcomas, the embryonal and the alveolar, differing in cytogenetic and 
      morphologic features. The alveolar type of rhabdomyosarcoma is frequently associated 
      with chromosome translocation t(2; 13) and poor clinical prognosis. Pathogenesis of 
      rhabdomyosarcoma remains obscure, and especially it occurs in the location where 
      skeletal muscle is absent. We report here that there is a high frequency of 
      association of rhabdomyosarcoma with ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene 
      mutation/deletion. Totally 17 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma specimens were studied by 
      immunohistochemical or immunofluorescent staining with ATM antibody and revealed 
      that 7 of the 17 cases were negative for ATM expression (41%). Further analyses of 
      rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines with RT-PCR revealed that in Rh30 cells, an alveolar 
      rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, there are three separate deletions/mutations of the ATM 
      mRNA. Western blotting analysis of the Rh30 cellular extract with anti-ATM antibody 
      showed that there is an aberrant form of ATM protein within the Rh30 cells that are 
      smaller than normal control. These results suggest, for the first time, a link of 
      ATM gene deletion/mutation with rhabdomyosarcoma, and since ATM kinase is a crucial 
      regulatory protein in DMA damage repair signaling pathway, and ATM deletion/mutation 
      may contribute to pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma.

TI  - Accumulation of DNA damage and reduced levels of nicotine adenine dinucleotide in 
      the brains of Atm-deficient mice.
PG  - 602-8
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a human genetic disorder caused by mutational 
      inactivation of the ATM gene. A-T patients display a pleiotropic phenotype, in which 
      a major neurological feature is progressive ataxia due to degeneration of cerebellar 
      Purkinje and granule neurons. Disruption of the mouse Atm locus creates a murine 
      model of A-T that exhibits most of the clinical and cellular features of the human 
      disease, but the neurological phenotype is barely expressed. We present evidence for 
      the accumulation of DNA strand breaks in the brains of Atm(-/-), supporting the 
      notion that ATM plays a major role in maintaining genomic stability. We also show a 
      perturbation of the steady state levels of pyridine nucleotides. There is a 
      significant decrease in both the reduced and the oxidized forms of NAD and in the 
      total levels of NADP(T) and NADP(+) in the brains of Atm(-/-) mice. The changes in 
      NAD(T), NADH, NAD(+), NADP(T), and NADP(+) were progressive and observed primarily 
      in the cerebellum of 4-month-old Atm(-/-) mice. Higher rates of mitochondrial 
      respiration were also recorded in 4-month-old Atm(-/-) cerebella. Taken together, 
      our findings support the hypothesis that absence of functional ATM results in 
      continuous stress, which may be an important cause of the degeneration of cerebellar 
      neurons in A-T.

AB  - Recent development of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) techniques is changing 
      the approach to search for mutations in human genetic diseases. We applied NGS to 
      study an A-T patient in which one of the two expected mutations was not found after 
      DHPLC, cDNA sequencing and MLPA screening. The 160-kb ATM genomic region was divided 
      into 31 partially overlapping fragments of 4-6 kb and amplified by long-range PCR in 
      the patient and mother, who carried the same mutation by segregation. We identified 
      six intronic variants that were shared by the two genomes and not reported in the 
      dbSNP(132) database. Among these, c.1236-405C>T located in IVS11 was predicted to be 
      pathogenic because it affected splicing. This mutation creates a cryptic novel donor 
      (5') splice site (score 1.00) 405 bp upstream of the exon 12 acceptor (3') splice 
      site. cDNA analysis showed the inclusion of a 212-bp non-coding 'pseudoexon' with a 
      premature stop codon. We validated the functional effect of the splicing mutation 
      using a minigene assay. Using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, designed to 
      mask the cryptic donor splice-site created by the c.1236-405C>T mutation, we 
      abrogated the aberrant splicing product to a wild-type ATM transcript, and in vitro 
      reverted the functional ATM kinase impairment of the patients' lymphoblasts. 
      Resequencing is an effective strategy for identifying rare splicing mutations in 
      patients for whom other mutation analyses have failed (DHPLC, MLPA, or cDNA 
      sequencing). This is especially important because many of these patients will carry 
      rare splicing variants that are amenable to antisense-based correction.

TI  - Incidence and clinical implications of ATM aberrations in chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia.
PG  - 1125-32
LID - 10.1002/gcc.21997 [doi]
AB  - A subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) carries mutations in ataxia 
      telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Such ATM mutations may be particularly relevant in the 
      setting of del11q, which invariably results in the deletion of one ATM allele. To 
      improve our understanding of the frequency and type of ATM mutations that exist in 
      CLL, we resequenced all ATM coding exons in 24 CLL with del11q using direct 
      sequencing. We detected two missense mutations, resulting in an ATM mutation 
      frequency of 8%; nonsense and frameshift mutations were not identified. Given the 
      low ATM mutation frequency detected in this cohort, we proceeded with measurements 
      of nonmutational ATM aberrations in CLL through analysis of the activation state of 
      ATM in response to external irradiation. The phosphorylation state of ATM at 
      Ser-1981 was measured using quantitative immunoblotting in purified CLL cells 
      isolated from 251 CLL patients; data were normalized to simultaneous measurements of 
      total ATM protein and actin. Resulting p-ATM/ATM and p-ATM/actin ratios were 
      subsequently analyzed for prognostic significance inclusive and exclusive of TP53 
      exons 2-10 mutations. From these analyses, conducted in a large prospectively 
      enrolled CLL patient cohort, neither the p-ATM/ATM nor the p-ATM/actin ratios were 
      found to be prognostic for short survival. These data in aggregate demonstrate a low 
      frequency of ATM aberrations in an unselected CLL cohort and do not support a major 
      prognostic role for ATM aberrations in CLL, thus motivating renewed research efforts 
      aimed at understanding the pathobiology of 11q deletions in CLL. © 2012 Wiley

PG  - 301-7
LID - 10.1177/1535370213480703 [doi]
AB  - The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is a key transducer of the cellular 
      response to DNA double strand breaks and its deficiency causes ataxia-telangiectasia 
      (A-T), a pleiotropic genetic disorder primarily characterized by cerebellar 
      neuropathy, immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition. While enormous progress has 
      been achieved in elucidating the biochemical and functional regulation of ATM in DNA 
      damage response, and more recently in redox signalling and antioxidant defence, the 
      factors that make neurons in A-T extremely vulnerable remain unclear. Given also 
      that ATM knockout mice do not recapitulate the central nervous system phenotype, a 
      number of human neural stem cell (hNSC) model systems have been developed to provide 
      insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration associated with ATM dysfunction. 
      Here we review the hNSC systems developed by us an others to model A-T.

TI  - Loss of expression of the double strand break repair protein ATM is associated with 
      worse prognosis in colorectal cancer and loss of Ku70 expression is associated with 
      CIN.
PG  - 1348-55
AB  - Repair of double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) is pivotal in maintaining normal cell 
      division and disruption of this system has been shown to be a key factor in 
      carcinogenesis. Loss of expression of the DSB repair proteins have previously been 
      shown to be associated with poorer survival in colorectal cancer. We wished to 
      ascertain the relationship of altered expression of the DSB repair proteins γ-H2AX 
      (gamma-H2AX), ATM and Ku70 with biological and clinico-pathological features of 
      colorectal cancer. 908 tumours from the VICTOR clinical trial of stage II/III 
      colorectal cancer were analysed for expression of γ-H2AX, ATM and Ku70 using 
      immunohistochemistry. Expression levels were correlated with CIN and with 
      disease-free survival, correcting for microsatellite instability, BRAF/KRAS mutation 
      status, Dukes stage, chemo/radiotherapy, age, gender and tumour location. 
      Down-regulated Ku70 expression was associated with chromosomal instability (p=0.029) 
      in colorectal cancer. Reduced ATM expression was an independent marker of poor 
      disease-free survival (HR=1.67, 95% CI 1.11-2.50, p=0.015). For Ku70, further 
      studies are required to investigate the potential relationship of non-homologous end 
      joining with chromosomal instability. Loss of ATM expression might serve as a 
      biomarker of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.

TI  - Lack of ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase induces structural and functional 
      changes in the heart: role in β-adrenergic receptor-stimulated apoptosis.
PG  - 506-15

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) is involved in cell cycle checkpoints, 
      DNA repair and apoptosis. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation induces cardiac 
      myocyte apoptosis. Here we analysed basal myocardial structure and function in ATM 
      knockout (KO) mice and tested the hypothesis that ATM modulates β-AR-stimulated 
      myocyte apoptosis. Left ventricular (LV) structure and function, myocyte apoptosis, 
      fibrosis and expression of fibrosis-, hypertrophy- and apoptosis-related proteins 
      were examined in wild-type (WT) and KO mice with or without l-isoprenaline treatment 
      for 24 h. Body and heart weights were lower in KO mice. M-Mode echocardiography 
      showed reduced septal wall thicknesses and LV diameters in KO mice. Doppler 
      echocardiography showed an increased ratio of early peak velocity (E wave) to that 
      of the late LV filling (A wave) in KO mice. Basal fibrosis and myocyte 
      cross-sectional area were greater in KO hearts. Expression of fibrosis-related genes 
      (connective tissue growth factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) and 
      hypertrophy-related gene (atrial natriuretic peptide) was higher in KO hearts. 
      β-Adrenergic receptor stimulation increased myocyte apoptosis to a similar extent in 
      both groups. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases and expression and 
      phosphorylation of p53 in response to β-AR stimulation were only observed in the WT 
      group. Akt phosphorylation was lower in KO sham-treated animals and remained lower 
      following β-AR stimulation in the KO group. β-Adrenergic receptor stimulation 
      activated glycogen synthase kinase-3β to a similar extent in both groups. Thus, lack 
      of ATM induces structural and functional changes in the heart, with enhanced 
      myocardial fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy. β-Adrenergic receptor-stimulated 
      apoptosis in WT hearts is associated with a p53- and JNKs-dependent mechanism, while 
      decreased Akt activity may play a role in increased myocyte apoptosis in the absence 
      of ATM.

TI  - ATM gene mutations result in both recessive and dominant expression phenotypes of 
      genes and microRNAs.
PG  - 243-53
LID - 10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.07.003 [doi]
AB  - The defining characteristic of recessive disorders is the absence of disease in 
      heterozygous carriers of the mutant alleles. However, it has been recognized that 
      recessive carriers may differ from noncarriers in some phenotypes. Here, we studied 
      ataxia telangiectasia (AT), a classical recessive disorder caused by mutations in 
      the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. We compared the gene and microRNA 
      expression phenotypes of noncarriers, AT carriers who have one copy of the ATM 
      mutations, and AT patients with two copies of ATM mutations. We found that some 
      phenotypes are more similar between noncarriers and AT carriers compared to AT 
      patients, as expected for a recessive disorder. However, for some expression 
      phenotypes, AT carriers are more similar to the patients than to the noncarriers. 
      Analysis of one of these expression phenotypes, TNFSF4 level, allowed us to uncover 
      a regulatory pathway where ATM regulates TNFSF4 expression through MIRN125B (also 
      known as miR-125b or miR125b) [corrected] In AT carriers and AT patients, this 
      pathway is disrupted. As a result, the level of MIRN125B is lower and the level of 
      its target gene, TNFSF4, is higher than in noncarriers. A decreased level of 
      MIRN125B is associated with breast cancer, and an elevated level of TNFSF4 is 
      associated with atherosclerosis. Thus, our findings provide a mechanistic suggestion 
      for the increased risk of breast cancer and heart disease in AT carriers. By 
      integrating molecular and computational analyses of gene and microRNA expression, we 
      show the complex consequences of a human gene mutation.

TI  - Atm-deficient mice exhibit increased sensitivity to dextran sulfate sodium-induced 
      colitis characterized by elevated DNA damage and persistent immune activation.
PG  - 1875-84
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2584 [doi]
AB  - The role of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a DNA double-strand break 
      recognition and response protein, in inflammation and inflammatory diseases is 
      unclear. We have previously shown that high levels of systemic DNA damage are 
      induced by intestinal inflammation in wild-type mice. To determine the effect of Atm 
      deficiency in inflammation, we induced experimental colitis in Atm(-/-), Atm(+/-), 
      and wild-type mice via dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration. Atm(-/-) mice 
      had higher disease activity indices and rates of mortality compared with 
      heterozygous and wild-type mice. Systemic DNA damage and immune response were 
      characterized in peripheral blood throughout and after three cycles of treatment. 
      Atm(-/-) mice showed increased sensitivity to levels of DNA strand breaks in 
      peripheral leukocytes, as well as micronucleus formation in erythroblasts, compared 
      with heterozygous and wild-type mice, especially during remission periods and after 
      the end of treatment. Markers of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species-mediated 
      damage, including 8-oxoguanine and nitrotyrosine, were present both in the distal 
      colon and in peripheral leukocytes, with Atm(-/-) mice manifesting more 8-oxoguanine 
      formation than wild-type mice. Atm(-/-) mice showed greater upregulation of 
      inflammatory cytokines and significantly higher percentages of activated CD69+ and 
      CD44+ T cells in the peripheral blood throughout treatment. ATM, therefore, may be a 
      critical immunoregulatory factor dampening the deleterious effects of chronic 
      DSS-induced inflammation, necessary for systemic genomic stability and homeostasis 
      of the gut epithelial barrier.

TI  - Identification of ATM mutations in Korean siblings with ataxia-telangiectasia.
PG  - 217-20
LID - 10.3343/alm.2013.33.3.217 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
      disorder. It is characterized by early-onset, progressive cerebellar ataxia, 
      oculomotor apraxia, choreoathetosis, conjunctival telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, 
      and an increased risk of malignancy. Although A-T is known to be the most common 
      cause of progressive cerebellar ataxia in childhood, there have been no confirmed 
      cases in Korea. We report the clinical and genetic findings of Korean siblings who 
      presented with limb and truncal ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, choreoathetosis, and 
      telangiectasias of the eyes. Sequence analysis of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated 
      (ATM) gene revealed a known missense mutation (c.8546G>C; p.Arg2849Pro) and a novel 
      intronic variant of intron 17 (c.2639-19_2639-7del13). Reverse-transcription PCR and 
      sequencing analysis revealed that the c.2639-19_2639-7del13 variant causes a 
      splicing aberration that potentiates skipping exon 18. Because A-T is quite rare in 
      Korea, the diagnosis of A-T in Korean patients can be delayed. We recommend that a 
      diagnosis of A-T should be suspected in Korean patients exhibiting the clinical 
      features of A-T.

PG  - 573-5
LID - 10.1007/s10072-012-1188-5 [doi]
AB  - Lifespan is attributable to genetic factors and some studies have attempted to 
      identify putative genes implicated in human longevity. Several genetic loci have 
      been associated with longevity, but some of these are not replicable, probably due 
      to the vast differences among ethnicities. We analyzed in 128 Italian long-lived 
      individuals and 150 unrelated healthy subjects, the recently reported association 
      between rs189037 in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene promoter and longevity in 
      Chinese nonagenarians/centenarians. Our study confirms the association between the 
      rs189037 C/T genotype and longevity in Italian centenarians, with an odds ratio of 
      1.85 (95 % CI 0.99-3.45). To understand the genetic basis for longevity is an 
      extraordinarily difficult task, and therefore it is important to replicate any 
      positive findings, especially if detected in other ethnic groups, in order to reach 
      reliable conclusions on the real effect that candidate genes have on longevity.

TI  - Heterozygous mutation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene aggravates 
      hypercholesterolemia in apoE-deficient mice.
PG  - 1380-7
AB  - Individuals with a heterozygous mutation at the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene 
      (ATM) have been reported to be predisposed to ischemic heart disease. This report 
      examined for the first time the effect of a heterozygous ATM mutation (ATM(+)(/-)) 
      on plasma lipid levels and atherosclerosis intensity using ATM(+/-), ATM(+)(/+) 
      (wild type), ATM(+)(/+)/LDLR(-)(/-) (low density lipoprotein receptor knockout), 
      ATM(+)(/-)/LDLR(-)(/-), ATM(+)(/+)/ApoE(-)(/-) (apolipoprotein E knockout), and 
      ATM(+)(/-)/ApoE(-)(/-) mice. Our data demonstrated that the plasma cholesterol and 
      triglyceride levels in ATM(+)(/-) and ATM(+)(/-)/LDLR(-)(/-) mice were approximately 
      the same as those in ATM(+)(/+) and ATM(+)(/+)/LDLR(-)(/-) control mice, 
      respectively. In contrast, the plasma cholesterol level was significantly higher in 
      ATM(+)(/-)/ApoE(-)(/-) mice than in ATM(+)(/+)/ApoE(-)(/-) control mice. In 
      addition, the ATM(+)(/-)/ApoE(-)(/-) mice showed higher plasma apoB-48 levels, 
      slower clearance for plasma apoB-48-carrying lipoproteins, and more advanced 
      atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta compared with the ATM(+)(/+)/ApoE(-)(/-) mice. 
      These novel results suggest that the product of ATM is involved in an 
      apoE-independent pathway for catabolism of apoB-48-carrying remnants; therefore, 
      superimposition of a heterozygous ATM mutation onto an ApoE deficiency background 
      reduces the clearance of apoB-48-carrying lipoproteins from the blood circulation 
      and promotes the formation of atherosclerosis.

TI  - Parents of ataxia-telangiectasia patients display a distinct cellular immune 
      phenotype mimicking ATM-mutated patients.
PG  - 349-357
LID - 10.1111/pai.13387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heterozygous relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) patients are at an 
      increased risk for certain AT-related manifestations. We also show that there is an 
      increase of infection frequency in parents of AT patients. Thus, we hypothesized 
      that the parents might exhibit immune alterations similar to their affected 
      children. METHODS: Lymphocyte phenotyping to enumerate T- and B-cell subsets was 
      performed. Functional analyses included in vitro quantified γ-H2AX, poly 
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-9 proteins. Chromosomal instability was 
      determined by comet assay. RESULTS: We analyzed 20 AT patients (14F/6M), 31 parents 
      (16F/15M), and 35 age-matched healthy controls. The AT patients' parents exhibited 
      low frequency of naive CD4(+) T- (n = 14, 45%) and recent thymic emigrants (n = 11, 
      35%) in comparison with the age-matched healthy donors. Interestingly, parents with 
      low naive T cells also demonstrated high rate of recurrent infections (9/14, 64%). 
      In comparison with age-matched controls, parents who had recurrent infections and 
      low naive T cells showed significantly higher baseline γ-H2AX levels and H(2) O(2) 
      -induced DNA damage as well as increased cleaved caspase-9 and PARP proteins. 
      CONCLUSION: Parents of AT patients could present with recurrent infections and 
      display cellular defects that mimic AT patients. The observed immunological changes 
      could be associated with increased DNA double-strand breaks.

TI  - Rapid screen for truncating ATM mutations by PTT-ELISA.
PG  - 139-44
LID - 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2008.01.002 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene are responsible for the 
      autosomal recessive genetic disorder, ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). Approximately 80% 
      of ATM mutations found in A-T patients results in truncations, which can be detected 
      by Protein Truncation Test (PTT). Conventional PTT uses SDS-PAGE electrophoresis to 
      detect mobility of radiolabeled truncated protein fragments. In this study, we 
      developed a non-radioactive Protein Truncation Test which utilizes an enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (PTT-ELISA) to detect ATM mutations in eight overlapping 
      fragments. N- and C-terminal epitopes (c-myc and V5, respectively) were introduced 
      into transcription/translation products, which could then be detected by Sandwich 
      ELISA. Using this assay, we screened 9 newly diagnosed A-T patients consecutively. 
      Of the 18 expected mutations, 14 truncating mutations were independently identified 
      by cDNA direct sequencing and/or DNA dHPLC analysis. PTT-ELISA detected all of these 
      14. Four mutations were novel. The PTT-ELISA provides a rapid method for detecting 
      truncating mutations in large genes and should be considered prior to using more 
      laborious or costly methods, such as direct sequencing.

TI  - Arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide dramatically enhances AMO-mediated ATM 
      aberrant splicing correction and enables delivery to brain and cerebellum.
PG  - 3151-60
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr217 [doi]
AB  - Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMOs) can reprogram pre-mRNA splicing by 
      complementary binding to a target site and regulating splice site selection, thereby 
      offering a potential therapeutic tool for genetic disorders. However, the 
      application of this technology into a clinical scenario has been limited by the low 
      correction efficiency in vivo and inability of AMOs to efficiently cross the blood 
      brain barrier and target brain cells when applied to neurogenetic disorders such as 
      ataxia-telangiecatasia (A-T). We previously used AMOs to correct subtypes of ATM 
      splicing mutations in A-T cells; AMOs restored up to 20% of the ATM protein and 
      corrected the A-T cellular phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that an 
      arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide, (RXRRBR)(2)XB, dramatically improved ATM 
      splicing correction efficiency when conjugated with AMOs, and almost fully corrected 
      aberrant splicing. The restored ATM protein was close to normal levels in cells with 
      homozygous splicing mutations, and a gene dose effect was observed in cells with 
      heterozygous mutations. A significant amount of the ATM protein was still detected 
      21 days after a single 5 µm treatment. Systemic administration of an fluorescein 
      isothiocyanate-labeled (RXRRBR)(2)XB-AMO in mice showed efficient uptake in the 
      brain. Fluorescence was evident in Purkinje cells after a single intravenous 
      injection of 60 mg/kg. Furthermore, multiple injections significantly increased 
      uptake in all areas of the brain, notably in cerebellum and Purkinje cells, and 
      showed no apparent signs of toxicity. Taken together, these results highlight the 
      therapeutic potential of (RXRRBR)(2)XB-AMOs in A-T and other neurogenetic disorders.

      Atm-deficient mice.
PG  - 572-8
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a human autosomal recessive disease caused by 
      mutations in the gene encoding ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). A-T is 
      characterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration, variable immunodeficiency, and 
      a high incidence of leukemia and lymphoma. Recurrent sino-pulmonary infections 
      secondary to immunodeficiency and hematopoietic malignancies are major causes of 
      morbidity and mortality in A-T patients. In mice, an introduced mutation in Atm 
      leads to a phenotype that recapitulates many of the symptoms of A-T, including 
      immune system abnormalities and susceptibility to malignancy. Here we show that the 
      replacement of the bone marrow compartment in Atm knockout mice (Atm(-/-)) using a 
      clinically relevant, nonmyeloablative host-conditioning regimen can be used to 
      overcome the immune deficiencies and prevent the malignancies observed in these 
      mice. Therefore, bone marrow transplantation may prove to be of therapeutic benefit 
      in A-T patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome 
      characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, 
      variable immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and cancer predisposition. Mutations 
      cause A-T in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene encoding a 
      serine/threonine-protein kinase. AREAS COVERED: The authors reviewed the literature 
      on PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to collect comprehensive data 
      related to A-T. This review aims to discuss various update aspects of A-T, including 
      epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prognosis, and 
      management. EXPERT OPINION: A-T as a congenital disorder has phenotypic 
      heterogeneity, and the severity of symptoms in different patients depends on the 
      severity of mutations. This review provides a comprehensive overview of A-T, 
      although some relevant questions about pathogenesis remain unanswered, probably 
      owing to the phenotypic heterogeneity of this monogenic disorder. The presence of 
      various clinical and immunologic manifestations in A-T indicates that the 
      identification of the role of defective ATM in phenotype can be helpful in the 
      better management and treatment of patients in the future.

TI  - Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and hypersegmented neutrophils in a patient with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder: potential diagnostic clues?
PG  - 1830-4
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.36546 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, 
      and has symptoms similar to ataxia-telangiectasia (AT). ATLD is caused by mutations 
      in the MRE11 gene, involved in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR). In contrast to 
      AT, ATLD patients lack key clinical features, such as telangiectasia or 
      immunodeficiency, and are therefore difficult to be diagnosed. We report a female 
      ATLD patient presenting with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and hypersegmented 
      neutrophils, previously undescribed features in this disorder, and potential 
      diagnostic clues to differentiate ATLD from other conditions. The patient showed 
      slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia from 2 years of age, and MRI revealed atrophy 
      of the cerebellum, oculomotor apraxia, mild cognitive impairment, writing dystonia, 
      hypergonadotropic hypogonadism with primary amenorrhea, and hypersegmented 
      neutrophils. Western blot assay demonstrated total loss of MRE11 and reduction of 
      ATM-dependent phosphorylation; thus, we diagnosed ATLD. Genetically, a novel 
      missense mutation (c.140C>T) was detected in the MRE11 gene, but no other mutation 
      was found in the patient. Our presenting patient suggests that impaired DSBR may be 
      associated with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and neutrophil hypersegmentation. In 
      conclusion, when assessing patients with ataxia of unknown cause, ATLD should be 
      considered, and the gonadal state and peripheral blood smear samples evaluated.

TI  - Twelve novel Atm mutations identified in Chinese ataxia telangiectasia patients.
PG  - 536-40
LID - 10.1007/s12017-013-8240-3 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized mainly 
      by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, and 
      immunodeficiency. This disease is caused by mutations of the ataxia telangiectasia 
      mutated (Atm) gene. More than 500 Atm mutations that are responsible for A-T have 
      been identified so far. However, there have been very few A-T cases reported in 
      China, and only two Chinese A-T patients have undergone Atm gene analysis. In order 
      to systemically investigate A-T in China and map their Atm mutation spectrum, we 
      recruited eight Chinese A-T patients from six unrelated families nationwide. Using 
      direct sequencing of genomic DNA and the multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
      amplification, we identified twelve pathogenic Atm mutations, including one 
      missense, four nonsense, five frameshift, one splicing, and one large genomic 
      deletion. All the Atm mutations we identified were novel, and no homozygous mutation 
      and founder-effect mutation were found. These results suggest that Atm mutations in 
      Chinese populations are diverse and distinct largely from those in other ethnic 
      areas.

PG  - 143-147
LID - 10.1007/s10048-021-00639-4 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder caused by 
      mutations in the gene of ATM serine/threonine kinase. It is characterized by 
      neurodegeneration, leading to severe ataxia, immunodeficiency, increased cancer 
      susceptibility, and telangiectasia. Here, we discovered a co-segregation of two ATM 
      gene variants with ataxia telangiectasia in an Egyptian family. While one of these 
      variants (NM_000051.4(ATM_i001):p.(Val128*)) has previously been reported as 
      pathogenic, the other one (NM_000051.4(ATM_i001):p.(Val1729Leu)) is regarded as a 
      variant of uncertain significance. Our findings in this family provide additional 
      evidence for causality of the second variant and argue that its status should be 
      changed to pathogenic.

AB  - Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by bi-allelic 
      mutations in the Ataxia-Telangiectasia-Mutated (ATM) gene. Complete lack of ATM 
      activity leads to severe A-T and mutations allowing for residual activity cause a 
      milder phenotype, termed variant A-T. There are only sparse data on the variability 
      in phenotypes of variant A-T patients carrying the same mutations. A retrospective 
      study of 15 patients with variant A-T, all double homozygous for the same mutations 
      was conducted. The age of first symptom ranged from 4-180 months, including: truncal 
      ataxia at <18 months of age in 9 patients, ataxia and instability only during fever 
      in one patient, dystonia in one patient and malignancy in 4 patients. Global 
      developmental delay and occulo-motor apraxia were recorded in 4/14 patients. Variant 
      A-T patients with the same mutations in ATM, have variable phenotypes. 
      Environmental, epigenetic, and post translational factors are likely to play a role 
      in creation of the phenotype in variant A-T patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A minority of breast cancer (BC) patients suffer from severe reaction to 
      adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Although deficient DNA double-strand break repair is 
      considered the main basis for the reactions, pretreatment identification of 
      high-risk patients has been challenging. METHODS: To retrospectively determine the 
      etiology of severe local reaction to RT in a 39-year-old woman with BC, we performed 
      next-generation sequencing followed by further clinical and functional studies. 
      RESULTS: We found a -4 intronic variant (c.2251-4A>G) in trans with a synonymous 
      (c.3576G>A) variant affecting the ATM DNA-repair gene (NG_009830.1, NM_000051.3) 
      which is linked to autosomal recessive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). We verified 
      abnormal transcripts resulting from both variants, next to a minor wild-type 
      transcript leading to a residual ATM kinase activity and genomic instability. 
      Follow-up examination of the patient revealed no classic sign of A-T but previously 
      unnoticed head dystonia and mild dysarthria, a family history of BC and late-onset 
      ataxia segregating with the variants. Additionally, her serum level of 
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated similar to A-T patients. CONCLUSION: 
      Considering the variable presentations of A-T and devastating impact of severe 
      reactions to RT, we suggest a routine measurement of AFP in RT-candidate BC patients 
      followed by next-generation sequencing with special attention to non-canonical 
      splice site and synonymous variants in ATM.

TI  - Over-expression of miR-100 is responsible for the low-expression of ATM in the human 
      glioma cell line: M059J.
PG  - 1170-5
LID - 10.1016/j.dnarep.2010.08.007 [doi]
AB  - M059J and M059K cells were isolated from different portions of the same human 
      malignant glioma. M059J cells are more radiosensitive than M059K cells due to the 
      absence of DNA-PKcs and low-expression of ATM. The mechanism concerning the absence 
      of DNA-PKcs in M059J is due to the frameshift mutation in PRKDC (DNA-PKcs gene); 
      however, the reason for the low-expression of ATM in M059J cells remains unclear. We 
      showed here that the main reason for the lower ATM level in M059J cells was not 
      related to the transcriptional regulation or protein degradation but was related to 
      post-transcriptional regulation. Based on database information, we found that the 
      3'-untranslational region (UTR) of ATM contains a miR-100 binding site. By using an 
      RNase protection assay and qRT-PCR, we identified that miR-100 is highly-expressed 
      in M059J cells. We further demonstrated that miR-100 bound to the 3'-UTR of ATM. 
      Knocking down miR-100 promotes ATM expression in M059J cells. Up-regulating miR-100 
      in M059K cells and other cancer cells reduces ATM expression and sensitizes these 
      cells to ionizing radiation. These results indicate that ATM is a target of miR-100, 
      elucidating that the low-expression of ATM in M059J cells is mainly due to the high 
      expression of miR-100. These results also suggest that miR-100 could be a useful 
      tool to target ATM and sensitize tumor cells to ionizing radiation.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive chromosomal breakage syndrome 
      caused by mutation of the ATM (A-T mutated) gene, which encodes a protein kinase 
      that has a major role in the cellular response to DNA damage. Approximately, 10% of 
      A-T patients develop lymphoid malignancies. Deaths caused by extreme sensitivity to 
      chemotherapy for malignancy have been reported, and cancer treatment in A-T is 
      extraordinarily difficult, needing careful monitoring and individualized protocols. 
      We report the case of a 12-year-old girl with A-T diagnosed at the age of 3 in 
      association with IgA deficiency and recurrent pulmonary infections. Sanger 
      sequencing revealed compound heterozygosity of the ATM gene, which bore two novel 
      mutations. At the age of 12, she developed stage IV T-cell/histiocyte-rich large 
      B-cell lymphoma. The tumor was resistant to chemotherapy, and she unfortunately died 
      of cardiac insufficiency and multiple organ failure induced by rapid progression of 
      the disease. The treatment approach for children with A-T and advanced-stage 
      B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma must be refined.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia is a hereditary multisystem disorder with a wide range of 
      symptoms and signs. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner due to a 
      mutation in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene, which encodes a protein 
      kinase with a domain related to a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase) 
      proteins that respond to DNA damage by phosphorylating key substrates involved in 
      DNA repair and/or cell cycle control. The characteristics of the disease include 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia beginning between ages one and four years, oculomotor 
      apraxia, choreoathetosis, telangiectasias of the conjunctiva, immunodeficiency with 
      frequent infections, and an increased risk for malignancy. In this article, we 
      report a novel homozygous missense variant c.1516G > T, p.(Gly506Cys) in the ATM 
      gene causing ataxia telangiectasia in a Saudi female. This variant led to the 
      development of a later onset disease (at the age of 14 years) and the classical 
      neurodegenerative process both clinically and on imaging. However, no immune system 
      dysfunction or endocrine abnormalities were present. This is the second novel 
      mutation in this gene so far reported from Saudi Arabia. The novel mutation 
      described in the present study widened the genetic spectrum of ATM-associated 
      diseases, which will benefit studies addressing this disease in the future.

AB  - The Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene in humans was identified as the basis 
      of a rare autosomal disorder leading to cancer susceptibility and is now well known 
      as an important signal transducer in response to DNA damage. An approach to 
      understanding the conserved functions of this gene is provided by the model system, 
      Caenorhabditis elegans. In this paper we describe the structure and loss of function 
      phenotype of the ortholog atm-1. Using bioinformatic and molecular analysis we show 
      that the atm-1 gene was previously misannotated. We find that the transcript is in 
      fact a product of three gene predictions, Y48G1BL.2 (atm-1), K10E9.1, and F56C11.4 
      that together make up the complete coding region of ATM-1. We also characterize 
      animals that are mutant for two available knockout alleles, gk186 and tm5027. As 
      expected, atm-1 mutant animals are sensitive to ionizing radiation. In addition, 
      however, atm-1 mutants also display phenotypes associated with genomic instability, 
      including low brood size, reduced viability and sterility. We document several 
      chromosomal fusions arising from atm-1 mutant animals. This is the first time a 
      mutator phenotype has been described for atm-1 in C. elegans. Finally we demonstrate 
      the use of a balancer system to screen for and capture atm-1-derived mutational 
      events. Our study establishes C. elegans as a model for the study of ATM as a 
      mutator potentially leading to the development of screens to identify therapeutic 
      targets in humans.

TI  - New diagnosis of atypical ataxia-telangiectasia in a 17-year-old boy with T-cell 
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a novel ATM mutation.
PG  - 581-584
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2017.6 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive chromosome breakage disorder 
      caused by mutations in the ATM gene. Typically, it presents in early childhood with 
      progressive cerebellar dysfunction along with immunodeficiency and oculocutaneous 
      telangiectasia. An increased risk of malignancy is also associated with the syndrome 
      and, rarely, may be the presenting feature in small children. We describe a 
      17-year-old boy with slurred speech, mild motor delays and learning disability 
      diagnosed with atypical A-T in the setting of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 
      Suspicion for A-T was raised after review of a peripheral blood karyotype 
      demonstrating rearrangements involving chromosomes 7 and/or 14. The diagnosis was 
      confirmed after molecular testing identified a novel homozygous missense variant in 
      ATM (c.5585T>A; p.Leu1862His) that resulted in protein instability and abolished 
      serine/threonine protein kinase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report 
      of concurrent A-T and lymphoid malignancy diagnoses in an older child or adult with 
      only mild neurological disease. Our experience suggests that screening for the 
      disorder should be considered in any individual with lymphoid malignancy and 
      neurological findings, especially as radiation and certain chemotherapy protocols 
      are contraindicated in A-T.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a genetic condition caused by mutations involving ATM 
      (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated). This gene is responsible for the expression of a 
      DNA double stranded break repair kinase, the ATM protein kinase. The syndrome 
      encompasses combined immunodeficiency and various degrees of neurological 
      abnormalities and increased risk of malignancy. Typically, patients present early in 
      life with delay in neurological milestones, but very infrequently, with life 
      threatening infections typical of a profound T cell deficiency. It would therefore 
      be unexpected to identify this condition immediately after birth using T cell 
      receptor excision circle (TREC)-based newborn screening (NBS) for SCID. We sought to 
      evaluate the frequency of AT detected by NBS, and to assess immunity as well as the 
      genetic aberrations associated with this early presentation. Here, we describe the 
      clinical, laboratory, and genetic features of patients diagnosed with AT through the 
      Ontario NBS program for SCID, and followed in our center since its inception in 
      2013. Four patients were diagnosed with AT as a result of low TRECs on NBS. In each 
      case, whole exome sequencing was diagnostic. All of our patients had compound 
      heterozygous mutations involving the FRAP-ATM-TRRAP (FAT) domain of the ATM gene, 
      which appears critical for kinase activity and is highly sensitive to mutagenesis. 
      Our patients presented with profound lymphopenia involving both B and T cells. The 
      ratio of naïve/memory CD45+RA/RO T cells population was variable. T cell repertoire 
      showed decreased T cell diversity. Two out of four patients had decreased specific 
      antibody response to vaccination and hypogammaglobulinemia requiring IVIG 
      replacement. In two patients, profound decreased responses to phytohemagglutinin 
      stimulation was observed. In the other two patients, the initial robust response 
      declined with time. In summary, the rate of detection of AT through NBS had been 
      surprisingly high at our center. One case was identified per year, while the total 
      rate for SCID has been five new cases per year. This early detection may allow for 
      better prospective evaluation of AT shortly after birth, and may assist in 
      formulating early and more effective interventions both for the neurological as well 
      as the immune abnormalities in this syndrome.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, the mutation of which causes the 
      autosomal recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia, plays an essential role in the 
      maintenance of genome stability. Extensive studies have revealed that activated ATM 
      signals to a massive list of proteins to facilitate cell cycle checkpoints, DNA 
      repair, and many other aspects of physiological responses in the event of DNA 
      double-strand breaks. ATM also plays functional roles beyond the well-characterized 
      DNA damage response (DDR). In this review article, we discuss the recent findings on 
      the molecular mechanisms of ATM in DDR, the mitotic spindle checkpoint, as well as 
      hyperactive ATM signaling in cancer invasion and metastasis.

      and other systemic complications. Patients with variant ataxia telangiectasia-with 
      some preserved ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase activity-have a milder and 
      often atypical phenotype, which can lead to long delays in diagnosis. Clinicians 
      need to be aware of the spectrum of clinical presentations of ataxia telangiectasia, 
      especially given the implications for malignancy surveillance and management. Here, 
      we review the phenotypes of ataxia telangiectasia, illustrated with case reports and 
      videos, and discuss its pathological mechanisms, diagnosis and management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by 
      a distinct range of clinical manifestations, including progressive ataxia, 
      immunodeficiency, and radiosensitivity. METHODS: Clinical data, laboratory results, 
      and genetic data were collected from forty-three A-T patients. Whole-exome 
      sequencing and Sanger sequencing were done for the patients clinically diagnosed as 
      suffering from A-T. Based on the phenotype severity of the disease, patients were 
      divided into severe and mild subgroups. RESULTS: The median (IQR) age of diagnosis 
      in this cohort was 5 (3-7) years, and various types of clinical manifestations, 
      including fever (P =.005), lower respiratory tract infection (P = .033), diarrhea 
      (P = .014), and hepatosplenomegaly (P = .032), were significantly higher among 
      patients diagnosed with the severe phenotype. Our results showed a correlation 
      between phenotype severity and mutation type. The chance of having severe phenotype 
      in patients who have severe mutations, including frameshift and nonsense, was 7.3 
      times higher than in patients who were categorized in the mild genotype group (odds 
      ratio = 7.3, P = .006). Thirty-four types of mutations including 9 novel mutations 
      were observed in our study. CONCLUSION: Molecular analysis provides the opportunity 
      for accurate diagnosis and timely management in A-T patients with chronic 
      progressive disease, especially infections and the risk of malignancies. This study 
      characterizes for the first time the broad spectrum of mutations and phenotypes in 
      Iranian A-T patients, which is required for carrier detection and reducing the 
      burden of disease in the future using the patients' families and for the public 
      healthcare system.

TI  - Reducing mitochondrial ROS improves disease-related pathology in a mouse model of 
      ataxia-telangiectasia.
PG  - 42-8
LID - 10.1038/mt.2012.203 [doi]
AB  - The disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) has no cure and few treatment options. It is 
      caused by mutations in the ATM kinase, which functions in the DNA-damage response 
      and redox sensing. In addition to severe cerebellar degeneration, A-T pathology 
      includes cancer predisposition, sterility, immune system dysfunction, and bone 
      marrow abnormalities. These latter phenotypes are recapitulated in the ATM null 
      (ATM(-/-)) mouse model of the disease. Since oxidative stress and mitochondrial 
      dysfunction are implicated in A-T, we determined whether reducing mitochondrial 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) via overexpression of catalase targeted to 
      mitochondria (mCAT) alleviates A-T-related pathology in ATM(-/-) mice. We found that 
      mCAT has many beneficial effects in this context, including reduced propensity to 
      develop thymic lymphoma, improved bone marrow hematopoiesis and macrophage 
      differentiation in vitro, and partial rescue of memory T-cell developmental defects. 
      Our results suggest that positive effects observed on cancer development may be 
      linked to mCAT reducing mitochondrial ROS, lactate production, and TORC1 signaling 
      in transforming double-positive cells, whereas beneficial effects in memory T cells 
      appear to be TORC1-independent. Altogether, this study provides proof-of-principle 
      that reducing mitochondrial ROS production per se may be therapeutic for the 
      disease, which may have advantages compared with more general antioxidant 
      strategies.

TI  - The association between ATM IVS 22-77 T>C and cancer risk: a meta-analysis.
PG  - e29479
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0029479 [doi]
LID - e29479
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It has become increasingly clear that ATM 
      (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) safeguards genome stability, which is a cornerstone 
      of cellular homeostasis, and ATM IVS 22-77 T>C affects the normal activity of ATM 
      proteins. However, the association between the ATM IVS 22-77 T>C genetic variant and 
      cancer risk is controversial. Therefore, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis to 
      estimate the overall cancer risk associated with the polymorphism and to quantify 
      any potential between-study heterogeneity. METHODS: A total of nine studies 
      including 4,470 cases and 4,862 controls were analyzed for ATM IVS 22-77 T>C 
      association with cancer risk in this meta-analysis. Heterogeneity among articles and 
      their publication bias were also tested. RESULTS: Our results showed that no 
      association reached the level of statistical significance in the overall risk. 
      Interestingly, in the stratified analyses, we observed an inverse relationship in 
      lung and breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Further functional research on the ATM mechanism 
      should be performed to explain the inconsistent results in different cancer types.

PG  - 1148-51
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182a55fa2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the cause of cervical dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) in a 
      Muslim Indian family inherited in an apparently autosomal recessive fashion, as 
      previously described in this journal. METHODS: Previous testing for mutations in the 
      genes known to cause DRD (GCH1, TH, and SPR) had been negative. Whole exome 
      sequencing was performed on all 3 affected individuals for whom DNA was available to 
      identify potentially pathogenic shared variants. Genotyping data obtained for all 3 
      affected individuals using the OmniExpress single nucleotide polymorphism chip 
      (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used to perform linkage analysis, autozygosity 
      mapping, and copy number variation analysis. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm 
      all variants. RESULTS: After filtering of the variants, exome sequencing revealed 2 
      genes harboring potentially pathogenic compound heterozygous variants (ATM and 
      LRRC16A). Of these, the variants in ATM segregated perfectly with the cervical DRD. 
      Both mutations detected in ATM have been shown to be pathogenic, and α-fetoprotein, 
      a marker of ataxia telangiectasia, was increased in all affected individuals. 
      CONCLUSION: Biallelic mutations in ATM can cause DRD, and mutations in this gene 
      should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained DRD, particularly 
      if the dystonia is cervical and if there is a recessive family history. ATM has 
      previously been reported to cause isolated cervical dystonia, but never, to our 
      knowledge, DRD. Individuals with dystonia related to ataxia telangiectasia may 
      benefit from a trial of levodopa.

TI  - Effects of antioxidants on cancer prevention and neuromotor performance in Atm 
      deficient mice.
PG  - 1371-7
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      immunodeficiency, neurodegeneration and cancer. The disease results from bi-allelic 
      mutations in the AT mutated (ATM) gene involved in cell cycle checkpoint control and 
      repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Evidence has been accumulating that oxidative 
      stress is associated with AT and may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. 
      This led to a hypothesis that antioxidants may alleviate the symptoms of AT. 
      Consequently, several studies were conducted in Atm deficient mice to examine the 
      role of antioxidants in cancer prevention and/or correction of neuromotor 
      performance. N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), EUK-189, tempol, and 
      5-carboxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl (CTMIO) have been tested in Atm 
      deficient mice. In contrast to other antioxidants, NAC has been used in the clinical 
      practice for many decades and is available as a dietary supplement. In this article, 
      we review chemoprevention studies in Atm deficient mice and, in more detail, our 
      findings on the effect of NAC. Our short-term study showed that NAC suppressed 
      genome rearrangements linked to cancer. The long-term study demonstrated that NAC 
      reduced the incidence and multiplicity of lymphoma and improved some aspects of 
      motor performance.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency and 
      cancer predisposition, caused by mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated 
      (ATM) gene. The clinical and immunological manifestations of A-T are very 
      heterogeneous, especially at an early age, leading to frequent misdiagnosis. 
      Cutaneous granulomas with unknown pathogenesis occur uncommonly in a minority of A-T 
      patients. We herein report an unusual case of a 13-year-old girl with A-T who 
      presented severe clinical manifestations, including multiple granulomatous lesions 
      of the skin and a class switch defect phenotype. This patient is the first Iranian 
      A-T case with cutaneous granulomatosis and immunodeficiency. In addition, the 
      literature on skin granulomas in all previously reported A-T patients is reviewed 
      indicating an increased frequency of elevated IgM level and female dominancy in this 
      selected group of patients.

TI  - Variant ataxia telangiectasia: clinical and molecular findings and evaluation of 
      radiosensitive phenotypes in a patient and relatives.

AB  - Variant ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) may be an underdiagnosed entity. We correlate 
      data from radiosensitivity and kinase assays with clinical and molecular data from a 
      patient with variant A-T and relatives. The coding region of ATM was sequenced. To 
      evaluate the functional effect of the mutations, we performed kinase assays and 
      developed a novel S-G2 micronucleus test. Our patient presented with mild dystonia, 
      moderately dysarthric speech, increased serum α-fetoprotein but no ataxia nor 
      telangiectasias, no nystagmus or oculomotor dyspraxia. She has a severe IgA 
      deficiency, but does not have recurrent infections. She is compound heterozygote for 
      ATM c.8122G>A (p.Asp2708Asn) and c.8851-1G>T, leading to in frame loss of 63 
      nucleotides at the cDNA level. A trace amount of ATM protein is translated from both 
      alleles. Residual kinase activity is derived only from the p.Asp2708Asn allele. The 
      conventional G0 micronucleus test, based on irradiation of resting lymphocytes, 
      revealed a radiosensitive phenotype for the patient, but not for the heterozygous 
      relatives. As ATM is involved in homologous recombination and G2/M cell cycle 
      checkpoint, we optimized an S-G2 micronucleus assay, allowing to evaluate 
      micronuclei in lymphocytes irradiated in the S and G2 phases. This test showed 
      increased radiosensitivity for both the patient and the heterozygous carriers. 
      Intriguingly, heterozygous carriers of c.8851-1G>T (mutation associated with absence 
      of kinase activity) showed a stronger radiosensitive phenotype with this assay than 
      heterozygous carriers of p.Asp2708Asn (mutation associated with residual kinase 
      activity). The modified S-G2 micronucleus assay provided phenotypic insight into 
      complement the diagnosis of this atypical A-T patient.

PG  - 2285-97
LID - 10.1084/jem.20081940 [doi]
AB  - Large numbers of genetic disorders are caused by nonsense mutations for which 
      compound-induced readthrough of premature termination codons (PTCs) might be 
      exploited as a potential treatment strategy. We have successfully developed a 
      sensitive and quantitative high-throughput screening (HTS) assay, protein 
      transcription/translation (PTT)-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for 
      identifying novel PTC-readthrough compounds using ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) as a 
      genetic disease model. This HTS PTT-ELISA assay is based on a coupled PTT that uses 
      plasmid templates containing prototypic A-T mutated (ATM) mutations for HTS. The 
      assay is luciferase independent. We screened approximately 34,000 compounds and 
      identified 12 low-molecular-mass nonaminoglycosides with potential PTC-readthrough 
      activity. From these, two leading compounds consistently induced functional ATM 
      protein in ATM-deficient cells containing disease-causing nonsense mutations, as 
      demonstrated by direct measurement of ATM protein, restored ATM kinase activity, and 
      colony survival assays for cellular radiosensitivity. The two compounds also 
      demonstrated readthrough activity in mdx mouse myotube cells carrying a nonsense 
      mutation and induced significant amounts of dystrophin protein.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an infrequent autosomal recessive multisystem 
      disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculo-cutaneous 
      telangiectasia, a tendency to malignancies and variable immunodeficiency. Here we 
      described a 5-year-old girl with atypical A-T symptoms. And 2 different ATM variants 
      c.5939_5948del in exon 40 and c.2639-384A > G in intron 17 were detected by whole 
      exome sequencing (WES) combined with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The variant spectrum 
      of ATM was expanded. RNA-seq makes up for deficiencies of WES. We proposed a new 
      approach, a dual-omics that combines RNA-seq with WES, for the diagnosis of genetic 
      diseases. Moreover, our study discussed the phenotypic heterogeneity of A-T among 
      family members as well as individuals. For children with recurrent infections and 
      immunodeficiency, we suggested focusing on A-T after the exclusion of other 
      potential diseases.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a severe autosomal recessive orphan disease 
      characterized by a number of peculiar clinical manifestations. Genetic diagnosis of 
      AT is complicated due to a large size of the causative gene, ATM. We used 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for the ATM analysis in 17 children with 
      the clinical diagnosis of AT. Biallelic mutations in the ATM gene were identified in 
      all studied subjects; these lesions included one large gene rearrangement, which was 
      reliably detected by NGS and validated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
      amplification (MLPA). There was a pronounced founder effect, as 17 of 30 (57%) 
      pathogenic ATM alleles in the patients of Slavic origin were represented by three 
      recurrent mutations (c.5932G > T, c.450_453delTTCT, and c.1564_1565delGA). These 
      data have to be taken into account while considering the genetic diagnosis and 
      screening for ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome.

AB  - Objectives: Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
      disorder with multisystem involvement caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous 
      mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene which encodes a 
      serine/threonine protein kinase. The aims of this study were to investigate class 
      switch recombination (CSR) and to review the clinical and immunologic phenotypes of 
      3 groups of A-T patients, including A-T patients with CSR defects (CSR-D), A-T 
      patients with selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (IgA-D) and A-T patients with 
      normal Ig level. Methods: In this study, 41 patients with confirmed diagnosis of A-T 
      (16 A-T patients with HIgM, 15 A-T patients with IgA-D, and 10 A-T patients with 
      normal Ig levels) from Iranian immunodeficiency registry center were enrolled. 
      B-cell proliferation, in vitro CSR toward IgE and IgA were compared between three 
      groups as well as G2 radiosensitivity assay. Results: Earliest presentation of 
      telangiectasia was a significant hallmark in A-T patients with CSR-D (p = .036). In 
      this investigation, we found that the frequency of respiratory infection (p = .002), 
      pneumonia (p = .02), otitis media (p = .008), chronic fever (p < .001), autoimmunity 
      (p = .02) and hepatosplenomegaly (p = .03) in A-T patients with HIgM phenotype were 
      significantly higher than the other groups. As expected IgE production stimulation 
      and IgA CSR were perturbed in HIgM patients that were aligned with the higher 
      readiosenstivity scores in this group. Conclusion: A-T patients with HIgM compared 
      to other A-T patients presenting more infections and noninfectious complications, 
      therefore, early detection and careful management of these patients is necessary.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a progressive multisystem autosomal recessive disorder 
      caused by mutations in the AT-mutated (ATM) gene. Early onset AT in children is 
      characterized by cerebellar degeneration, leading to motor impairment. Lung disease 
      and cancer are the two most common causes of death in AT patients. Accelerated 
      thymic involution may contribute to the cancer, and recurrent and/or chronic 
      respiratory infections may be a contributing factor to lung disease in AT. AT 
      patients have fertility issues, are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation and they 
      present oculocutaneous telangiectasia. Current treatments only slightly ameliorate 
      disease symptoms; therapy that alters or reverses the course of the disease has not 
      yet been discovered. Previously, we have shown that ATM(-/-) pigs, a novel model of 
      AT, present with a loss of Purkinje cells, altered cerebellar cytoarchitecture and 
      motor coordination deficits. ATM(-/-) porcine model not only recapitulates the 
      neurological phenotype, but also other multifaceted clinical features of the human 
      disease. Our current study shows that ATM(-/-) female pigs are infertile, with 
      anatomical and functional signs of an immature reproductive system. Both male and 
      female ATM(-/-) pigs show abnormal thymus structure with decreased cell cycle and 
      apoptosis markers in the gland. Moreover, ATM(-/-) pigs have an altered immune 
      system with decreased CD8(+) and increased natural killer and CD4(+)CD8(+) 
      double-positive cells. Nevertheless, ATM(-/-) pigs manifest a deficient IgG response 
      after a viral infection. Based on the neurological and peripheral phenotypes, the 
      ATM(-/-) pig is a novel genetic model that may be used for therapeutic assessments 
      and to identify pathomechanisms of this disease.

TI  - Genetics of ataxia telangiectasia in a highly consanguineous population.
PG  - 34-44

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare autosomal recessive multisystemic disorder. It 
      usually presents in toddler years with progressive ataxia and oculomotor apraxia, or 
      less commonly, in the late-first or early-second decade of life with mixed movement 
      disorders. Biallelic mutations in ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) cause AT 
      phenotype, a disease not well documented in Saudi Arabia, a highly consanguineous 
      society. We studied several Saudi AT patients, identified ATM variants, and 
      investigated associated clinical features. We included 17 patients from 12 
      consanguineous families. All patients had comprehensive clinical and radiological 
      assessment, and most were examined through whole-exome sequencing (WES). Selected 
      individuals were analyzed using various genetic approaches. We identified five 
      different ATM variants in our patients: three previously reported mutations, and two 
      novel variants. Nearly all patients had classical AT presentation except for two 
      patients with a milder phenotype. Among the three known variants, a deletion causing 
      truncation (c.381delA resulting in p.(Val128Ter)) was identified in 13 patients. Two 
      patients harboured the other two truncating variants, (c.9001_9002delAG resulting in 
      p.Ser3001Phefs*6) and (c.9066delA resulting in p.Glu3023Alafs*10) and two patients 
      had novel compound heterozygous variants (NM_000051.3:Paternal 
      Allele:c.8762C > G;p.Thr2921Arg and Maternal Allele:c.1057T > C;p.Cys353Arg). We 
      speculate that c.381delA is a founder mutation in our population. This study 
      provides a genotype-phenotype relationship in a previously unstudied consanguineous 
      population. Our findings contribute to improve local clinical care, therapy, and 
      genetic counseling.

AB  - Recruitment and activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase 
      regulate multiple cell-cycle checkpoints relevant to complex biological events like 
      DNA damage repair and apoptosis. Molecularly specific readouts of ATM using protein 
      assays, fluorescence, or radiolabeling have advanced significantly over the past few 
      years. This Review covers the molecular imaging techniques that enable the 
      visualization of ATM-from traditional quantitative protein assays to the potential 
      use of ATM inhibitors to generate new imaging agents to interrogate ATM. We are 
      confident that molecular imaging coupled with advanced technologies will play a 
      pivotal role in visualizing and understanding the biology of ATM and accelerate its 
      applications in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease, including radiation therapy 
      and patient stratification.

PG  - 2971-2975
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.61870 [doi]
AB  - Mild clinical phenotypes of ataxia-telangiectasia (variant A-T) are associated with 
      biallelic ATM variants resulting in residual function of the ATM kinase. At least 
      one regulatory, missense, or leaky splice site mutation resulting in expression of 
      ATM with low level kinase activity was identified in subjects with variant A-T. 
      Studies on the pathogenicity of the germline splicing ATM variant c.1066-6T>G have 
      provided conflicting results. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified two splice 
      site ATM variants, c.1066-6T>G; [p.?], and c.2250G>A, [p.Ile709_Lys750del], in a 
      compound heterozygous state in a 27-year-old woman who had been diagnosed as having 
      congenital ocular motor apraxia type Cogan in her childhood. Reappraisal of her 
      clinical phenotype revealed consistency with variant A-T. Functional analyses showed 
      reduced expression of ATM protein and residual activity of the ATM kinase at a level 
      consistent with variant A-T. Our results provide evidence for pathogenicity of the 
      leaky ATM splice site variant c.1066-6T>G.

AB  - Ataxia telangictasia mutated (ATM) is involved in DNA repair pathway and cell-cycle 
      checkpoints. ATM alterations were found in medulloblastomas, gliomas, but not in 
      astrocytoma. The polymorphism D1853N was reported in healthy individuals and 
      medulloblastomas. We could observe this polymorphism, heterozygously, in a proband 
      affected with astrocytoma and traced it through her pedigree. We propose the 
      three-hit hypothesis as a triangle initiators includes D1853N as a first 
      predisposing hit, IVS 38- 63T --> A as a second hit deriving from the first somatic 
      evolution before differentiation and IVS 38- 30 A --> G as a third hit through the 
      development of an astrocytoma. In addition, the D1853N polymorphism was occurred in 
      different allele from IVS 38- 63T --> A and IVS 38- 30 A --> G.

AB  - Since identification of mutations in the ATM gene leading to ataxia-telangiectasia, 
      enormous efforts have been devoted to discovering the roles this protein plays in 
      DNA repair as well as other cellular functions. Even before the identification of 
      ATM mutations, it was clear that other diseases with different genomic loci had very 
      similar neurological symptoms. There has been significant progress in understanding 
      why cancer and immunodeficiency occur in ataxia-telangiectasia even though many 
      details remain to be determined, but the field is no closer to determining why the 
      nervous system requires ATM and other DNA repair genes. Even though rodent disease 
      models have similar DNA repair abnormalities as the human diseases, they have no 
      consistent, robust neuropathological phenotype making it difficult to understand the 
      neurological underpinnings of disease. Therefore, it may be useful to reassess the 
      neurological and neuropathological characteristics of ataxia-telangiectasia in human 
      patients to look for potential commonalities in DNA repair diseases that result in 
      ataxia. In doing so, it is clear that ataxia-telangiectasia and similar diseases 
      share neurological features other than merely ataxia, such as length-dependent motor 
      and sensory neuropathies, and that the neuroanatomical localization for these 
      symptoms is understood. Cells affected in ataxia-telangiectasia and similar diseases 
      are some of the largest single nucleated cells in the body. In addition, a subset of 
      these diseases also has extrapyramidal movements and oculomotor apraxia. These 
      neurological and neuropathological similarities may indicate a common DNA repair 
      related pathogenesis with very large cell size as a critical risk factor.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a complex multisystem disorder characterized by 
      progressive neurological impairment, variable immunodeficiency and oculo-cutaneous 
      telangiectasia. A-T is a member of chromosomal breakage syndromes and it is caused 
      by a mutation in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. Because of a wide 
      clinical heterogeneity, A-T is often difficult to diagnose in children. We report an 
      unusual case of a 3-year-old boy affected by A-T who presented exclusively with 
      extensive cutaneous granulomatosis and severe combined immunodeficiency, without 
      neurological abnormalities, at the time of diagnosis. This case clearly emphasizes 
      the variable presentation of A-T syndrome and highlights the difficulties in the 
      early diagnosis of A-T. A-T should be considered in children with evidence of 
      combined humoral and cellular immunodeficiency associated with unexplained skin 
      granulomatous lesions, even in the absence of the classic features of this syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) is an inherited multisystem disorder with 
      cerebellar neurodegeneration. The relationships between imaging metrics of 
      cerebellar health and neurological function across childhood in A-T are unknown, but 
      may be important for determining timing and impact of therapeutic interventions. 
      PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that abnormalities of cerebellar structure, 
      physiology and cellular health occur in childhood A-T and correlate with 
      neurological disability, we performed multiparametric cerebellar MRI and establish 
      associations with disease status in childhood A-T. METHODS: Prospective 
      cross-sectional observational study. 22 young people (9 females / 13 males, age 
      6.6-17.8 years) with A-T and 24 matched healthy controls underwent 3-Tesla MRI with 
      volumetric, diffusion and proton spectroscopic acquisitions. Participants with A-T 
      underwent structured neurological assessment, and expression / activity of 
      ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase were recorded. RESULTS: 
      Ataxia-telangiectasia participants had cerebellar volume loss (fractional total 
      cerebellar volume: 5.3% vs 8.7%, P < 0.0005, fractional 4th ventricular volumes: 
      0.19% vs 0.13%, P < 0.0005), that progressed with age (fractional cerebellar 
      volumes, r = -0.66, P = 0.001), different from the control group (t = -4.88, 
      P < 0.0005). The relationship between cerebellar volume and age was similar for A-T 
      participants with absent ATM kinase production and those producing non-functioning 
      ATM kinase. Markers of cerebellar white matter injury were elevated in 
      ataxia-telangiectasia vs controls (apparent diffusion coefficient: 
      0.89 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) vs 0.69 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1), p < 0.0005) and correlated 
      (age-corrected) with neurometabolite ratios indicating impaired neuronal viability 
      (N-acetylaspartate:creatine r = -0.70, P < 0.001); gliosis (inositol:creatine 
      r = 0.50, P = 0.018; combined glutamine/glutamate:creatine r = -0.55, P = 0.008) and 
      increased myelin turnover (choline:creatine r = 0.68, P < 0.001). Fractional 4th 
      ventricular volume was the only variable retained in the regression model predicting 
      neurological function (adjusted r(2) = 0.29, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative 
      MRI demonstrates cerebellar abnormalities in children with A-T, providing 
      non-invasive measures of progressive cerebellar injury and markers reflecting 
      neurological status. These MRI metrics may be of value in determining timing and 
      impact of interventions aimed at altering the natural history of A-T.

TI  - Ataxia-telangiectasia and the ATM gene: linking neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, 
      and cancer to cell cycle checkpoints.
PG  - 254-60
AB  - Defects in regulation of the cellular life cycle may lead to premature cellular 
      death or malignant transformation. Most of the proteins known to be involved in 
      these processes are mediators of mitogenic signals or components of the cell cycle 
      machinery. It has recently become evident, however, that systems responsible for 
      ensuring genome stability and integrity are no less important in maintaining the 
      normal life cycle of the cell. These systems include DNA repair enzymes and a 
      recently emerging group of proteins that alert growth regulating mechanisms to the 
      presence of DNA damage. These signals slow down the cell cycle while DNA repair 
      ensues. Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a genetic disorder whose clinical and 
      cellular phenotype points to a defect in such a signaling system. A-T is 
      characterized by neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, cancer 
      predisposition, and defective cell cycle checkpoints. The responsible gene, ATM, was 
      recently cloned and sequenced. ATM encodes a large protein with a region highly 
      similar to the catalytic domain of PI 3-kinases. The ATM protein is similar to a 
      group of proteins in various organisms which are directly involved in the cell cycle 
      response to DNA damage. It is expected to be part of a protein complex that responds 
      to a specific type of DNA strand break by conveying a regulatory signal to other 
      proteins. Interestingly, the immune and nervous systems, which differ markedly in 
      their proliferation rates, are particularly sensitive to the absence of ATM 
      function. The identification of the ATM gene highlights the growing importance of 
      signal transduction initiated in the nucleus rather than in the external 
      environment, for normal cellular growth.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder caused by 
      mutations of ATM gene. And dystonia may develop as a late manifestation in typical 
      AT. Here we report a novel homozygous frameshift ATM mutation (c.1402_1403delAA; p. 
      K468Efs*18) in a 10-year-old male. The patient was diagnosed as typical AT according 
      to clinical presentations which included progressive cerebellar ataxia, 
      oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immune deficiency, and cerebellar atrophy. The 
      genetic finding confirmed the diagnosis. Severe dystonia was presented in late stage 
      of this disease. After 3 months of trihexyphenidyl treatment, the frequency of 
      dystonia was reduced significantly. Although dystonia is not uncommon in phenotype 
      spectrum of AT, compared with other symptoms of this syndrome, such as cerebellar 
      ataxia and dysarthria, dystonia can be treated.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      disruption of the gene, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Present study was aimed 
      at identifying proteins that are present in abnormal levels in A-T brain that may 
      identify alternative targets for therapeutic interventions. Proteomic and Western 
      blot analysis have shown massive expression of the small heat shock protein 27 
      (Hsp27) in frontal cortices of A-T brains compared to negligible levels in controls. 
      The expression of other stress proteins, Hsp70, alphaB-crystallin, and prohibitin 
      remained unchanged in the A-T and control brains. Significant decreases in reactive 
      oxygen species, protein carbonyl groups and lipid peroxidation products were 
      observed in the A-T brains. There is no evidence of caspase 3 activation or DAXX 
      mediated apoptosis. We propose that neurons in the frontal lobe are protected by the 
      expression of Hsp27, which scavenges the oxidative stress molecules formed 
      consequent to the primary loss of ATM function.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive multi-system disorder caused 
      by mutation in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM). ATM is a large 
      serine/threonine protein kinase, a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related 
      protein kinase (PIKK) family whose best-studied function is as master controller of 
      signal transduction for the DNA damage response (DDR) in the event of double strand 
      breaks (DSBs). The DDR rapidly recognizes DNA lesions and initiates the appropriate 
      cellular programs to maintain genome integrity. This includes the coordination of 
      cell-cycle checkpoints, transcription, translation, DNA repair, metabolism, and cell 
      fate decisions, such as apoptosis or senescence. DSBs can be generated by exposure 
      to ionizing radiation (IR) or various chemical compounds, such as topoisomerase 
      inhibitors, or can be part of programmed generation and repair of DSBs via cellular 
      enzymes needed for the generation of the antibody repertoire as well as the 
      maturation of germ cells. AT patients have immunodeficiency, and are sterile with 
      gonadal dysgenesis as a result of defect in meiotic recombination. In the cells of 
      nervous system ATM has additional role in vesicle dynamics as well as in the 
      maintenance of the epigenetic code of histone modifications. Moderate levels of ATM 
      are associated with prolonged lifespan through resistance to oxidative stress. ATM 
      inhibitors are being viewed as potential radiosensitizers as part of cancer 
      radiotherapy. Though there is no cure for the disease at present, glucocorticoids 
      have been shown to induce alternate splicing site in the gene for ATM partly 
      restoring its activity, but their most effective timing in the disease natural 
      history is not yet known. Gene therapy is promising but large size of the gene makes 
      it technically difficult to be delivered across the blood-brain barrier at present. 
      As of now, apart from glucocorticoids, use of histone deacetylase inhibitors/EZH2 to 
      minimize effect of the absence of ATM, looks more promising.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration that is typically diagnosed in early childhood. 
      A-T is associated with a predisposition to malignancies, particularly lymphoid 
      tumors in childhood and early adulthood. An adolescent girl with minimal neurologic 
      symptoms was diagnosed with A-T 8 years after completing therapy for T-cell acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia, following a diagnosis of ATM-mutated breast cancer in her 
      mother. We highlight the importance of recognizing ATM mutations in T-cell acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia, appreciating the phenotypic heterogeneity of A-T, and 
      defining optimal cancer screening in A-T patients.

TI  - ATM Kinase Dead: From Ataxia Telangiectasia Syndrome to Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13215498 [doi]
LID - 5498
AB  - ATM is one of the principal players of the DNA damage response. This protein exerts 
      its role in DNA repair during cell cycle replication, oxidative stress, and DNA 
      damage from endogenous events or exogenous agents. When is activated, ATM 
      phosphorylates multiple substrates that participate in DNA repair, through its 
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase like domain at the 3'end of the protein. The absence of 
      ATM is the cause of a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Ataxia Telangiectasia 
      characterized by cerebellar degeneration, telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, cancer 
      susceptibility, and radiation sensitivity. There is a correlation between the 
      severity of the phenotype and the mutations, depending on the residual activity of 
      the protein. The analysis of patient mutations and mouse models revealed that the 
      presence of inactive ATM, named ATM kinase-dead, is more cancer prone and lethal 
      than its absence. ATM mutations fall into the whole gene sequence, and it is very 
      difficult to predict the resulting effects, except for some frequent mutations. In 
      this regard, is necessary to characterize the mutated protein to assess if it is 
      stable and maintains some residual kinase activity. Moreover, the whole-genome 
      sequencing of cancer patients with somatic or germline mutations has highlighted a 
      high percentage of ATM mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase domain, mostly in 
      cancer cells resistant to classical therapy. The relevant differences between the 
      complete absence of ATM and the presence of the inactive form in in vitro and in 
      vivo models need to be explored in more detail to predict cancer predisposition of 
      A-T patients and to discover new therapies for ATM-associated cancer cells. In this 
      review, we summarize the multiple discoveries from humans and mouse models on ATM 
      mutations, focusing into the inactive versus null ATM.

      research. METHODS: Movement disorder specialists examined 20 Canadian Mennonite 
      adult probands with primary-appearing dystonia, as well as relatives in 4 families 
      with parent-child transmission of dystonia. We screened for the exon 43 c.6200 C>A 
      (p. A2067D) ATM mutation and mutations in DYT1 and DYT6. Clinical features of the 
      individuals with dystonia who were harboring ATM mutations were compared with those 
      of individuals without mutations. RESULT: Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous 
      founder mutation in ATM in 13 members from 3 of the families, and no one harbored 
      DYT6 or DYT1 mutations. Dystonia in ATM families mimicked other forms of early-onset 
      primary torsion dystonia, especially DYT6, with prominent cervical, cranial, and 
      brachial involvement. Mean age at onset was markedly younger in the patients with 
      variant A-T (n = 12) than in patients with other dystonia (n = 23), (12 years vs 40 
      years, p < 0.05). The patients with A-T were remarkable for the absence of notable 
      cerebellar atrophy on MRI, lack of frank ataxia on examination, and absence of 
      ocular telangiectasias at original presentation, as well as the presence of 
      prominent myoclonus-dystonia in 2 patients. Many also developed malignancies. 
      CONCLUSION: Ataxia and telangiectasias may not be prominent features of patients 
      with variant A-T treated for dystonia in adulthood, and variant A-T may mimic 
      primary torsion dystonia and myoclonus-dystonia.

      relatives.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia is a recessive genetic disorder (ATM is the mutated gene) of 
      childhood with severe motor impairments and whereas homozygotes manifest the 
      disorder, heterozygotes are asymptomatic. Structural brain imaging and post-mortem 
      studies in individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia have reported cerebellar atrophy; 
      but abnormalities of motor control characteristic of extrapyramidal dysfunction 
      suggest impairment of broader motor networks. Here, we investigated possible 
      dysfunction in other brain areas in individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia and 
      tested for brain changes in asymptomatic relatives to assess if heterozygocity 
      affects brain function. We used positron emission tomography and 
      (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose to measure brain glucose metabolism (quantified as µmol/100 
      g/min), which serves as a marker of brain function, in 10 adults with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia, 19 non-affected adult relatives (12 siblings, seven parents) 
      and 29 age-matched healthy controls. Statistical parametric mapping and region of 
      interest analyses were used to compare individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia, 
      asymptomatic relatives, and unrelated controls. We found that participants with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia had lower metabolism in cerebellar hemispheres (14%, P < 
      0.001), anterior vermis (40%, P < 0.001) and fusiform gyrus (20%, P < 0.001) 
      compared with controls or siblings, and lower metabolism in hippocampus (12%, P = 
      0.05) compared with controls, and showed significant intersubject variability 
      (decreases in vermis ranged from 18% to 60%). Participants with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia also had higher metabolism in globus pallidus (16%, P = 0.05), 
      which correlated negatively with motor performance. Asymptomatic relatives had lower 
      metabolism in anterior vermis (12%; P = 0.01) and hippocampus (19%; P = 0.002) than 
      controls. Our results indicate that, in addition to the expected decrease in 
      cerebellar metabolism, participants with ataxia-telangiectasia had widespread 
      changes in metabolic rates including hyperactivity in globus pallidus indicative of 
      basal ganglia involvement. Changes in basal ganglia metabolism offer potential 
      insight into targeting strategies for therapeutic deep brain stimulation. Our 
      finding of decreased metabolism in vermis and hippocampus of asymptomatic relatives 
      suggests that heterozygocity influences the function of these brain regions.

AB  - Ataxia Telangiectasia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutated ATM 
      gene. The most debilitating symptom of Ataxia Telangiectasia is the progressive 
      neurodegeneration of the cerebellum, though the molecular mechanisms driving this 
      degeneration remains unclear. Here we describe the generation and validation of an 
      induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from an olfactory biopsy from a patient 
      with Ataxia Telangiectasia. Sequencing identified two previously unreported 
      disease-causing mutations in the ATM gene. This line can be used to generate 2D and 
      3D patient-specific neuronal models enabling investigations into the mechanisms 
      underlying neurodegeneration.

AB  - The human genetic disorder ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is characterised by 
      neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, cell cycle checkpoint 
      defects, genomic instability and cancer predisposition. Progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia represents the most debilitating aspect of this disorder. At present, there 
      is no therapy available to cure or prevent the progressive symptoms of A-T. While it 
      is possible to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with immunodeficiency and 
      deficient lung function, neither the predisposition to cancer nor the progressive 
      neurodegeneration can be prevented. Significant effort has focused on improving our 
      understanding of various clinical, genetic and immunological aspects of A-T; 
      however, little attention has been directed towards identifying altered brain 
      structure and function using MRI. To date, most imaging studies have reported 
      radiological anomalies in A-T. This review outlines the clinical and biological 
      features of A-T along with known radiological imaging anomalies. In addition, we 
      briefly discuss the advent of high-resolution MRI in conjunction with 
      diffusion-weighted imaging, which enables improved investigation of the 
      microstructural tissue environment, giving insight into the loss in integrity of 
      motor networks due to abnormal neurodevelopmental or progressive neurodegenerative 
      processes. Such imaging approaches have yet to be applied in the study of A-T and 
      could provide important new information regarding the relationship between mutation 
      of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene and the integrity of motor 
      circuitry.

TI  - Compound heterozygous variants including a novel copy number variation in a child 
      with atypical ataxia-telangiectasia: a case report.
PG  - 204
LID - 10.1186/s12920-021-01053-3 [doi]
LID - 204
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by alterations in the ATM gene. The majority of ATM pathogenic 
      variants are frameshift or nonsense variants which are predicted to truncate the 
      whole ATM protein. Herein, we report on an ataxia telangiectasia child with atypical 
      phenotype who was identified as compound heterozygous for two ATM variants involving 
      a previously described pathogenic single nucleotide variation (SNV) and a novel copy 
      number variation (CNV). CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-year-old boy presented with delayed 
      development and oculomotor apraxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed interval 
      development of mild atrophy in the cerebellum. Serum alpha fetoprotein level was in 
      normal range. Next-generation sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism array 
      tests were performed. Next-generation sequencing revealed a heterozygous nonsense 
      pathogenic variant in ATM, c.742C > T (p.Arg248Ter) inherited from the father. 
      Single-nucleotide polymorphism array revealed a compound heterozygous CNV, 
      arr[GRCh37] 11q22.3(10851766-108183226) × 1, 31460 bp (exons 24-40 deletion of ATM) 
      inherited from the mother, which was validated by reverse transcription-polymerase 
      chain reaction analysis (RT-PCR). We demonstrated that this variant 
      (NM_000051.4:c.3403_6006del) generated a product of in-frame deletion of exon 24-40 
      of ATM (p.Ser1135_Gln2002del). CONCLUSIONS: The compound heterozygosity for ATM 
      variants involving a previously described pathogenic SNV and a novel CNV may be 
      associated with the atypical clinical manifestations. This clinical report extends 
      the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of ATM pathogenic variants in atypical 
      ataxia-telangiectasia, thus making implementation of advanced analysis beyond the 
      routine next-generation sequencing an important consideration in diagnosis and 
      rehabilitation services for children with ataxia-telangiectasia.

TI  - Mechanisms Underlying the Suppression of Chromosome Rearrangements by 
      Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated.
LID - 10.3390/genes12081232 [doi]
LID - 1232
AB  - Chromosome rearrangements are structural variations in chromosomes, such as 
      inversions and translocations. Chromosome rearrangements have been implicated in a 
      variety of human diseases. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive 
      disorder characterized by a broad range of clinical and cellular phenotypes. At the 
      cellular level, one of the most prominent features of A-T cells is chromosome 
      rearrangement, especially that in T lymphocytes. The gene that is defective in A-T 
      is ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). The ATM protein is a serine/threonine kinase 
      and plays a central role in the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly DNA 
      double-strand breaks. In this review, the mechanisms by which ATM suppresses 
      chromosome rearrangements are discussed.

TI  - Patient with ataxia telangiectasia undergoing elective staging laparoscopy: A case 
      report and literature review.
PG  - 2656-2658
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.01740 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia is a rare autosomal recessive condition which develops due to 
      a mutation in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM gene). As a result of this 
      mutation, the ability of the DNA to undergo repair is undermined. The resulting 
      cellular demise is responsible for the diverse presentation of the clinical 
      condition. Neurological symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, abnormal eye movements 
      and malignancies occur commonly, while immunodeficiency predisposes these patients 
      to recurrent infections. Perioperative management of patients with this rare 
      condition can be associated with increased morbidity. Therefore, it is recommended 
      that patients with ataxia telangiectasia should be managed in a multidisciplinary 
      centre, under the supervision of senior clinicians who have the insight into the 
      clinical needs of such patients. We report herein, the perioperative management of a 
      patient with ataxia telangiectasia undergoing laparoscopic procedure. This case 
      report will allow the readers to increase their knowledge and understanding when it 
      comes to the management of these patients.

TI  - Clinical and immunological assessment of children with ataxia telangiectasia 
      attending Sohag university hospital in Upper Egypt.
PG  - 272-281
AB  - Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is a very rare autosomal recessive primary immune 
      deficiency (PID) disease that affects 1 in 10,000-40,000 new births per year in the 
      world. It is caused by biallelic mutations in ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) 
      gene and characterized by a progressive cerebellar ataxia. The clinical profile of 
      AT children in Upper Egypt in missing. Herein, we evaluated the clinical 
      characteristics and immunological profiles of patients with AT attending Sohag 
      University Hospital. This was a cross-sectional study, included 21 AT patients 
      attending the Neurological and Immunological Units, Pediatric Department, Sohag 
      University Hospital, starting April 2018 to the end of March 2019. AT represented 
      20.5% of all PID patients attending the hospital. The most common type of humoral 
      immune deficiency in patients with AT was specific IgA deficiency (52.3%) followed 
      by hypogammaglobulinemia (23.8%). Recurrent sinopulmonary infection with different 
      degrees of severity was the common immunological problem. The most common 
      neurological manifestations in our studied patients, other than the ataxia, were 
      language delay and eye movement abnormalities followed by developmental delay and 
      head nodding. None of our patients had developed malignancy till the end of the 
      study.

TI  - Early diagnosis of ataxia telangiectasia in the neonatal phase: a parents' 
      perspective.
PG  - 251-256
LID - 10.1007/s00431-019-03479-5 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder with variable 
      immunodeficiency. Together with the Dutch A-T community, we investigated the opinion 
      of A-T parents on an early A-T diagnosis in the asymptomatic phase of the disease. 
      During an annual national meeting for A-T patients and families, the topic of an 
      early A-T diagnosis was discussed in relation to the recent introduction of neonatal 
      screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in the Netherlands. Based on 
      the discussion, individual arguments were identified and processed into a 
      questionnaire, which was sent out to 64 A-T parents (32 families). Arguments 
      included were insecurity to diagnosis, possible medical advantages, appropriate 
      genetic counseling and family planning, loss of "golden" year(s), and early cancer 
      screening for parents. The response rate was 55% (n = 35 parents). Twenty-six (74%) 
      parents felt that the advantages of an early diagnosis outweighed the disadvantages, 
      five parents thought that the disadvantages would outweigh the advantages (14%), and 
      four parents did not indicate a preference.Conclusion: The majority of parents of a 
      child with A-T would have preferred an early diagnosis during the asymptomatic phase 
      of the disease, because the uncertainty during the diagnostic process had had a 
      major impact on their lives. In addition, the knowledge of being carriers of an ATM 
      gene mutation influenced decisions about family planning. Parents who opposed 
      against an early diagnosis emphasized the joy of having a seemingly healthy child 
      until diagnosis.What is Known:• Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a devastating DNA 
      repair disorder with a huge impact on quality of life of patients and their 
      parents.• Patients with A-T may incidentally be identified at birth as the 
      consequence of neonatal screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).What 
      is New:• The majority of Dutch parents of A-T patients (74%) would have preferred an 
      early diagnosis of their child in the asymptomatic phase of the disease.• Major 
      arguments for an early A-T diagnosis were (1) the experienced insecurity in 
      diagnostic trajectories and its impact on families and (2) the knowledge of being 
      ATM mutation carriers when deciding about family planning. An argument against an 
      early diagnosis is losing the joy of having a seemingly healthy child until 
      diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dystonia is a common hyperkinetic movement disorder in children; 
      however, making an early and definitive diagnosis of dystonia can sometimes be 
      challenging for clinicians. CASE: Herein, we report a case of a 16 years-old girl 
      presenting with laryngeal dystonia due to compound heterozygosity of a known 
      pathogenic and a novel variant in the ATM gene. Serum alpha-fetoprotein level was 
      elevated. Serum IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE levels were within normal range. Treatment 
      with L-DOPA had no benefit. Her symptoms were dramatically improved by localized 
      botulinum toxin injections. CONCLUSION: Mutations in the ATM gene show a wide 
      phenotypic spectrum from severe classical early-onset ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) to 
      late-onset milder variant A-T. Our findings highlight the importance of recognizing 
      laryngeal dystonia as one of the clinical signs of A-T.

TI  - Genetic Risk Variants for Class Switching Recombination Defects in 
      Ataxia-Telangiectasia Patients.
LID - 10.1007/s10875-021-01147-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
      caused by mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. A-T patients 
      manifest considerable variability in clinical and immunological features, suggesting 
      the presence of genetic modifying factors. A striking heterogeneity has been 
      observed in class switching recombination (CSR) in A-T patients which cannot be 
      explained by the severity of ATM mutations. METHODS: To investigate the cause of 
      variable CSR in A-T patients, we applied whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 20 A-T 
      patients consisting of 10 cases with CSR defect (CSR-D) and 10 controls with normal 
      CSR (CSR-N). Comparative analyses on modifier variants found in the exomes of these 
      two groups of patients were performed. RESULTS: For the first time, we identified 
      some variants in the exomes of the CSR-D group that were significantly associated 
      with antigen processing and presentation pathway. Moreover, in this group of 
      patients, the variants in four genes involved in DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) 
      repair signaling, in particular, XRCC3 were observed, suggesting an association with 
      CSR defect. CONCLUSION: Additional impact of certain variants, along with ATM 
      mutations, may explain the heterogeneity in CSR defect phenotype among A-T patients. 
      It can be concluded that genetic modulators play an important role in the course of 
      A-T disease and its clinical severity.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by 
      mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. In the absence of a 
      family history, the diagnosis of A-T is usually not made until the child is older 
      and symptomatic. Classic A-T is characterized by a constellation of clinical 
      symptoms including progressive ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias and 
      sinopulmonary disease and is usually associated with absence of ATM protein. Other 
      laboratory features associated with A-T include elevated serum levels of 
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and increased chromosomal breakage with in vitro exposure to 
      ionizing radiation. Sinopulmonary symptoms can occur to varying degrees across the 
      lifespan. Some children will also have hypogammaglobulinemia and impaired antibody 
      responses requiring supplemental gamma globulin. People with hypomorphic ATM 
      mutations are often considered to have mild A-T with onset of ataxia and 
      neurological progression occurring later in life with less impairment of the immune 
      system. The risk of malignancy, however, is significantly increased in people with 
      either classic or mild A-T. While hematological malignancies are most common in the 
      first two decades of life, solid organ malignancies become increasingly common 
      during young adulthood. Deterioration of neurologic function with age is associated 
      with dysphagia with aspiration, growth faltering, loss of ambulation and decline in 
      pulmonary function, morbidities that contribute to shortened life expectancy and 
      decreased quality of life. Premature death is often due to malignancies or chronic 
      respiratory insufficiency. A-T is currently managed with supportive care and 
      symptomatic treatment. Current clinical trials, however, represent progress and hope 
      towards disease-modifying therapies for A-T.

      ataxia-telangiectasia lymphoblastoid cells.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by 
      biallelic mutations in the Ataxia Telangiectasia-mutated gene. A-T shows a complex 
      phenotype ranging from early-onset progressive neurodegeneration to 
      immunodeficiencies, high incidence of infections, and tumors. Unfortunately, no 
      therapy is up to now available for treating this condition. Recently, the short term 
      treatment of ataxia-telangiectasia patients with glucocorticoids was shown to 
      improve their neurological symptoms and possibly reverse cerebellar atrophy. Thus, 
      corticosteroids represent an attractive approach for the treatment of this 
      neurodegenerative disease. However, the molecular mechanism involved in 
      glucocorticoid action in A-T is yet unknown. The aim of our work is to construct 
      cDNA libraries containing those genes which are transactivated by the glucocorticoid 
      analogue, dexamethasone, in A-T human cells. For this purpose, suppression 
      subtractive hybridization has been performed on ATM-null lymphoblastoid cell 
      transcriptome extracted following drug administration. Annotation of whole genes 
      contained in the libraries has been obtained by coupling subtractive hybridization 
      with microarray analysis. Positive transcripts have been validated by quantitative 
      PCR. Through in silico analyses, identified genes have been classified on the basis 
      of the pathway in which they are involved, being able to address signaling required 
      for dexamethasone action. Most of the induced transcripts are involved in metabolic 
      processes and regulation of cellular processes. Our results can help to unravel the 
      mechanism of glucocorticoid action in the reversion of A-T phenotype. Moreover, the 
      induction of a specific region of the ATM transcript has been identified as putative 
      biomarker predictive of dexamethasone efficacy on ataxic patients.

PG  - 596-9
LID - 10.1007/s12311-013-0460-4 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) due to mutations in the MRE11 gene is a 
      very rare autosomal recessive disease, described so far in only 20 patients. Little 
      is known about the onset of the first symptoms or the clinical course of the 
      disease. The present report contributes to the diagnosis of ATLD and its prognosis 
      at onset. We report 30 years of clinical and ophthalmic observations and the results 
      of quantitative magnetic resonance (MR), MR spectroscopy (proton magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopic imaging) and neuropsychological assessment in the first Italian 
      siblings identified with ATLD. Although the disease had early onset and the clinical 
      picture was initially severe, suggesting ataxia-telangiectasia, neurological 
      impairment, ocular motor apraxia and neuropsychological tests showed very slow 
      deterioration in adult age. The patients developed eye and head motor strategies to 
      compensate ocular motor apraxia. MR measurements and MR spectroscopy disclosed 
      widespread neuronal and axonal involvement. ATLD should be considered in patients 
      with ocular apraxia and ataxia in infancy. The long follow-up provided insights into 
      clinical outcome, with functional neuroimaging studies shedding light on the 
      pathogenetic mechanisms of this rare disease.

TI  - A novel, ataxic mouse model of ataxia telangiectasia caused by a clinically relevant 
      nonsense mutation.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.64695 [doi]
LID - e64695
AB  - Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) and Ataxia with Ocular Apraxia Type 1 (AOA1) are 
      devastating neurological disorders caused by null mutations in the genome stability 
      genes, A-T mutated (ATM) and Aprataxin (APTX), respectively. Our mechanistic 
      understanding and therapeutic repertoire for treating these disorders are severely 
      lacking, in large part due to the failure of prior animal models with similar null 
      mutations to recapitulate the characteristic loss of motor coordination (i.e., 
      ataxia) and associated cerebellar defects. By increasing genotoxic stress through 
      the insertion of null mutations in both the Atm (nonsense) and Aptx (knockout) genes 
      in the same animal, we have generated a novel mouse model that for the first time 
      develops a progressively severe ataxic phenotype associated with atrophy of the 
      cerebellar molecular layer. We find biophysical properties of cerebellar Purkinje 
      neurons (PNs) are significantly perturbed (e.g., reduced membrane capacitance, lower 
      action potential [AP] thresholds, etc.), while properties of synaptic inputs remain 
      largely unchanged. These perturbations significantly alter PN neural activity, 
      including a progressive reduction in spontaneous AP firing frequency that correlates 
      with both cerebellar atrophy and ataxia over the animal's first year of life. Double 
      mutant mice also exhibit a high predisposition to developing cancer (thymomas) and 
      immune abnormalities (impaired early thymocyte development and T-cell maturation), 
      symptoms characteristic of A-T. Finally, by inserting a clinically relevant 
      nonsense-type null mutation in Atm, we demonstrate that Small Molecule Read-Through 
      (SMRT) compounds can restore ATM production, indicating their potential as a future 
      A-T therapeutic.

TI  - A-TWinnipeg: Pathogenesis of rare ATM missense mutation c.6200C>A with decreased 
      protein expression and downstream signaling, early-onset dystonia, cancer, and 
      life-threatening radiotoxicity.
PG  - 332-40

AB  - We studied 10 Mennonite patients who carry the c.6200C>A missense mutation 
      (p.A2067D) in the ATM gene, all of whom exhibited a phenotypic variant of 
      ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) that is characterized by early-onset dystonia and 
      late-onset mild ataxia, as previously described. This report provides the 
      pathogenetic evidence for this mutation on cellular functions. Several patients have 
      developed cancer and subsequently experienced life-threatening adverse reactions to 
      radiation (radiotoxicity) and/or chemotherapy. As the c.6200C>A mutation is, thus 
      far, unique to the Mennonite population and is always associated with the same 
      haplotype or haplovariant, it was important to rule out any possible confounding DNA 
      variant on the same haplotype. Lymphoblastoid cells derived from Mennonite patients 
      expressed small amounts of ATM protein, which had no autophosphorylation activity at 
      ATM Ser1981, and trace-to-absent transphosphorylation of downstream ATM targets. A-T 
      lymphoblastoid cells stably transfected with ATM cDNA which had been mutated for 
      c.6200C>A did not show a detectable amount of ATM protein. The same stable cell line 
      with mutated ATM cDNA also showed a trace-to-absent transphosphorylation of 
      downstream ATM targets SMC1pSer966 and KAP1pSer824. From these results, we conclude 
      that c.6200A is the disease-causing ATM mutation on this haplotype. The presence of 
      at least trace amounts of ATM kinase activity on some immunoblots may account for 
      the late-onset, mild ataxia of these patients. The cause of the dystonia remains 
      unclear. Because this dystonia-ataxia phenotype is often encountered in the 
      Mennonite population in association with cancer and adverse reactions to 
      chemotherapy, an early diagnosis is important.

TI  - Experimental antioxidant therapy in ataxia telangiectasia.
PG  - 431-6
AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by 
      immunodeficiency, early onset neurological degeneration, hypersensitivity to 
      ionizing radiation and a high incidence of lymphoid cancers. The disease results 
      from bi-allelic mutations in the AT mutated (ATM) gene involved in cell cycle 
      checkpoint control and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Evidence has been 
      accumulating that oxidative stress is associated with AT and may be involved in the 
      pathogenesis of the disease. This led to a hypothesis that antioxidant therapy may 
      mitigate the symptoms of AT, especially neurological degeneration and tumorigenesis. 
      Consequently, several studies examined the effect of antioxidants in Atm deficient 
      mice used as an animal model of AT. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), EUK-189, tempol and 
      5-carboxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl (CTMIO) have been tested for their 
      chemopreventive properties and had some beneficial effects. In addition to 
      antioxidants, cancer therapeutic agent dexamethasone was examined for cancer 
      prevention in Atm deficient mice. Of the tested antioxidants, only NAC has wide 
      clinical applications due to safety and efficacy and is available as an 
      over-the-counter dietary supplement. In this article, we review chemoprevention 
      studies in Atm deficient mice and, in more detail, our findings on the effect of 
      NAC. The short-tem study showed that NAC suppressed genome rearrangements linked to 
      cancer. The long-term study demonstrated that NAC reduced both the incidence and 
      multiplicity of lymphoma.

AB  - Microglial inflammation is often seen as a secondary event in neurodegeneration. A 
      recent study by Song et al. demonstrates that loss of ataxia telangiectasia mutated 
      (ATM) activates microglia through the cytosolic DNA sensor STING. This highlights 
      the ability of microglia to recognize and respond to self-DNA, with potentially 
      neurotoxic consequences.

TI  - Bone Marrow Transplantation as Therapy for Ataxia-Telangiectasia: A Systematic 
      Review.
LID - 10.3390/cancers12113207 [doi]
LID - 3207
AB  - Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, first reported 
      in 1926, caused by a deficiency of ATM (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated) protein. The 
      disease is characterized by progressive cerebellar neurodegeneration, 
      immunodeficiency, leukemia, and lymphoma cancer predisposition. Immunoglobulin 
      replacement, antioxidants, neuroprotective factors, growth, and anti-inflammatory 
      hormones are commonly used for A-T treatment, but, to date, there is no known cure. 
      Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a successful therapy for several forms of 
      diseases and it is a valid approach for tumors, hemoglobinopathies, autoimmune 
      diseases, inherited disorders of metabolism, and other pathologies. Some case 
      reports of A-T patients have shown that BMT is becoming a good option, as a correct 
      engraftment of healthy cells can restore some aspects of immunologic capacity. 
      However, due to a high risk of mortality as a result of a clinical and cellular 
      hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, a specific 
      non-myeloablative conditioning is required before BMT. Although BMT might be 
      considered as one promising therapy for the treatment of immunological defects and 
      cancer prevention in selected A-T patients, the therapy is currently not recommended 
      or recognized and the eligibility of A-T patients for BMT is a point to deepen and 
      deliberate.

AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by 
      mutations in the ATM gene, resulting in faulty repair of breakages in 
      double-stranded DNA. The clinical phenotype is complex and is characterized by 
      neurologic abnormalities, immunodeficiencies, susceptibility to malignancies, 
      recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and cutaneous abnormalities. Lung disease is 
      common in patients with A-T and often progresses with age and neurological decline. 
      Diseases of the respiratory system cause significant morbidity and are a frequent 
      cause of death in the A-T population. Lung disease in this population is thought to 
      exhibit features of one or more of the following phenotypes: recurrent sinopulmonary 
      infections with bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, and lung disease 
      associated with neurological abnormalities. Here, we review available evidence and 
      present expert opinion on the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of lung disease 
      in A-T, as discussed in a recent multidisciplinary workshop. Although more data are 
      emerging on this unique population, many recommendations are made based on 
      similarities to other more well-studied diseases. Gaps in current knowledge and 
      areas for future research in the field of pulmonary disease in A-T are also 
      outlined.

TI  - Classic ataxia-telangiectasia: the phenotype of long-term survivors.
PG  - 830-837
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09641-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with classic ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) generally die in the 
      second or third decade of life. Clinical descriptions of A-T tend to focus on the 
      symptoms at presentation. However, during the course of the disease, other symptoms 
      and complications emerge. As long-term survivors with classic A-T develop a complex 
      multisystem disorder with a largely unknown extent and severity, we aimed to 
      comprehensively assess their full clinical picture. METHODS: Data from Dutch 
      patients with classic A-T above the age of 30 years were retrospectively collected. 
      In addition, we searched the literature for descriptions of classic A-T patients who 
      survived beyond the age of 30 years. RESULTS: In the Dutch cohort, seven classic A-T 
      patients survived beyond 30 years of age. Fourteen additional patients were 
      retrieved by the literature search. Common problems in older patients with classic 
      A-T were linked to ageing. Most patients had pulmonary, endocrine, cardiovascular, 
      and gastro-intestinal problems. All patients had a tetraparesis with contractures. 
      This led to immobilization and frequent hospital admissions. Most patients expressed 
      the wish to no longer undergo intensive medical treatments, and waived follow-up 
      programs. CONCLUSIONS: Paucity of descriptions in the literature, and withdrawal 
      from medical care complicate the acquisition of follow-up data on the natural 
      history of long-term survivors. Irrespective of these limitations, we have obtained 
      impression of the many problems that these patients face when surviving beyond 
      30 years of age. Awareness of these problems is needed to guide follow-up, 
      counselling, and (palliative) care; decisions about life-prolonging treatments 
      should be well considered.
