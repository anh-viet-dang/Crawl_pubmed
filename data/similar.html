AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 80 813 
      confirmed cases in all provinces of China, and 21 110 cases reported in 93 countries 
      of six continents as of 7 March 2020 since middle December 2019. Due to biological 
      nature of the novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) with faster spreading and unknown transmission pattern, it makes us 
      in a difficulty position to contain the disease transmission globally. To date, we 
      have found it is one of the greatest challenges to human beings in fighting against 
      COVID-19 in the history, because SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 
      in terms of biological features and transmissibility, and also found the containment 
      strategies including the non-pharmaceutical public health measures implemented in 
      China are effective and successful. In order to prevent a potential pandemic-level 
      outbreak of COVID-19, we, as a community of shared future for mankind, recommend for 
      all international leaders to support preparedness in low and middle income countries 
      especially, take strong global interventions by using old approaches or new tools, 
      mobilize global resources to equip hospital facilities and supplies to protect 
      noisome infections and to provide personal protective tools such as facemask to 
      general population, and quickly initiate research projects on drug and vaccine 
      development. We also recommend for the international community to develop better 
      coordination, cooperation, and strong solidarity in the joint efforts of fighting 
      against COVID-19 spreading recommended by the joint mission report of the WHO-China 
      experts, against violating the International Health Regulation (WHO, 2005), and 
      against stigmatization, in order to eventually win the battle against our common 
      enemy - COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged disease that has become a 
      global public health concern as it rapidly spread around the world. The etiologic 
      agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of 
      Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a 
      pandemic in 2002. This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it 
      follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human 
      infection remains a mystery. By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 
      confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 shows several 
      similarities with SARS?CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 
      (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations. This can vary from asymptomatic 
      infection to severe disease and mortality. Real-time reverse-transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard 
      laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. There is no proven antiviral agent 
      against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the 
      management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications. The outbreak of 
      COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures 
      throughout the world. Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections 
      are being clinically researched to find possible treatment. Similarly, the 
      traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, 
      social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple 
      countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks. This 
      review aims to enhance our understanding of COVID 19. Keywords: Coronavirus disease 
      2019; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus 2019; severe acute respiratory

TI  - The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic: A review of the current 
      evidence.
PG  - 147-159
LID - 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_519_20 [doi]
AB  - A novel coronavirus (nCoV) spillover event, with its epicenter in Wuhan, People's 
      Republic of China, has emerged as a public health emergency of international 
      concern. This began as an outbreak in December 2019, and till February 28, 2020, 
      there have been 83,704 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      globally, with 2,859 deaths, resulting in an overall case fatality rate of 3.41 per 
      cent (95% confidence interval 3.29-3.54%). By this time (February 28, 2020) 58 
      countries or territories and one international conveyance (Diamond Princess Cruise 
      Ship) were affected. As a part of the global response to manage and contain the 
      pandemic, major emphasis was placed on generating research intelligence to guide 
      evidence-based responses to contain the virus, which was named severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), owing to its genetic similarities 
      with the SARS virus. This review summarizes the emerging evidence which can help 
      guide the public health response, particularly in India. Key areas have been 
      identified in which research needs to be conducted to generate critical intelligence 
      for advising prevention and control efforts. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has once 
      again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness, ability to 
      respond to an infectious threat, the rapidity of transmission of infections across 
      international borders and the ineffectiveness of knee-jerk policy responses to 
      emerging/re-emerging infectious disease threats. The review concludes with the key 
      learning points from the ongoing efforts to prevent and contain COVID-19 and 
      identifies the need to invest in health systems, community-led response mechanisms 
      and the need for preparedness and global health security.

TI  - Risk estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory disease outbreak outside China.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/s12976-020-00127-6 [doi]
LID - 9
AB  - BACKGROUND: On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was alerted to the 
      occurrence of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, that were caused 
      by an unknown virus, which was later identified as a coronavirus and named the 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to estimate 
      the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 in the Hubei Province and evaluate the risk of 
      an acute respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak outside China by using 
      a mathematical model and stochastic simulations. RESULTS: We constructed a 
      mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, estimated the rate of 
      transmission, and calculated the reproductive number in Hubei Province by using 
      case-report data from January 11 to February 6, 2020. The possible number of 
      secondary cases outside China was estimated by stochastic simulations in various 
      scenarios of reductions in the duration to quarantine and rate of transmission. The 
      rate of transmission was estimated as 0.8238 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.8095-0.8382), and the basic reproductive number as 4.1192 (95% CI 4.0473-4.1912). 
      Assuming the same rate of transmission as in Hubei Province, the possibility of no 
      local transmission is 54.9% with a 24-h quarantine strategy, and the possibility of 
      more than 20 local transmission cases is 7% outside of China. CONCLUSION: The 
      reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is significantly higher 
      compared to that of the previous SARS epidemic in China. This implies that 
      human-to-human transmission is a significant factor for contagion in Hubei Province. 
      Results of the stochastic simulation emphasize the role of quarantine 
      implementation, which is critical to prevent and control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak 
      outside China.

AB  - Public health measures were decisive in controlling the SARS epidemic in 2003. 
      Isolation is the separation of ill persons from non-infected persons. Quarantine is 
      movement restriction, often with fever surveillance, of contacts when it is not 
      evident whether they have been infected but are not yet symptomatic or have not been 
      infected. Community containment includes measures that range from increasing social 
      distancing to community-wide quarantine. Whether these measures will be sufficient 
      to control 2019-nCoV depends on addressing some unanswered questions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Japan implemented a large-scale quarantine on the Diamond Princess 
      cruise ship in an attempt to control the spread of the novel coronavirus severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in February 2020. OBJECTIVE: 
      We aim to describe the medical activities initiated and difficulties in implementing 
      quarantine on a cruise ship. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed for all 3711 people (2666 
      passengers and 1045 crew) on board. RESULTS: Of those tested, 696 (18.8%) tested 
      positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), of which 410 (58.9%) were asymptomatic. 
      We also confirmed that 54% of the asymptomatic patients with a positive RT-PCR 
      result had lung opacities on chest computed tomography. There were many difficulties 
      in implementing quarantine, such as creating a dividing traffic line between 
      infectious and noninfectious passengers, finding hospitals and transportation 
      providers willing to accept these patients, transporting individuals, language 
      barriers, and supporting daily life. As of March 8, 2020, 31 patients (4.5% of 
      patients with positive RT-PCR results) were hospitalized and required ventilator 
      support or intensive care, and 7 patients (1.0% of patients with positive RT-PCR 
      results) had died. CONCLUSIONS: There were several difficulties in implementing 
      large-scale quarantine and obtaining medical support on the cruise ship. In the 
      future, we need to prepare for patients' transfer and the admitting hospitals when 
      disembarking the passengers. We recommend treating the crew the same way as the 
      passengers to control the infection. We must also draw a plan for the future, to 
      protect travelers and passengers from emerging infectious diseases on cruise ships.

AB  - Several Italian towns are under lockdown to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The level 
      of transmission reduction required for physical distancing interventions to mitigate 
      the epidemic is a crucial question. We show that very high adherence to community 
      quarantine (total stay-home policy) and a small household size is necessary for 
      curbing the outbreak in a locked-down town. The larger the household size and amount 
      of time in the public, the longer the lockdown period needed.

TI  - The novel zoonotic COVID-19 pandemic: An expected global health concern.
PG  - 254-264
LID - 10.3855/jidc.12671 [doi]
AB  - 18 years ago, in 2002, the world was astonished by the appearance of Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), supported by a zoonotic coronavirus, called SARS-CoV, 
      from the Guangdong Province of southern China. After about 10 years, in 2012, 
      another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 
      (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people 
      with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, 
      causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak 
      remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose 
      from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 
      persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 
      global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially 
      Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir 
      continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover 
      effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, 
      illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, 
      evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and 
      thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a 
      large part of the world. Herein we will provide with an update on the main features 
      of COVID-19 and suggest possible solutions how to halt the expansion of this novel 
      pandemic.

AB  - Coronavirus (CoV) has been one of the major pandemic threats to human health in the 
      last two decades. The human coronavirus was first identified in 1960s. CoVs 229E, 
      NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV have caused numerous disasters or human 
      deaths worldwide. Recently, an outbreak of the previously unknown deadly CoV disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2, early 
      named 2019-nCoV) occurred in Wuhan, China, and it had caused 81238 cases of 
      confirmed infection, including 3250 deaths until March 19, 2020. Its risks and 
      pandemic potential have brought global consideration. We summarized epidemiology, 
      virological characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, clinical 
      treatments, and prevention methods for COVID-19 to present a reference for the 
      future wave of probable CoV outbreaks.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: A new outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 in Wuhan, China, is spreading rapidly around the globe. Limited 
      information on control in community settings is available. OBJECTIVE: To detail 
      measures enacted within a community to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate the spread of COVID-19 associated with 
      implementation of the program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series 
      study details the implementation of prevention measures in a specific community 
      setting among community-dwelling individuals exposed to or at risk of COVID-19 in 
      Haiyu, Shenzhen, China, from January 23 to April 10, 2020. EXPOSURES: Community 
      containment strategies for tracking, quarantine, and management were strictly, 
      cooperatively, and effectively implemented by a team that included a general 
      practitioner, a community manager, and public safety bureau officials. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Number of locally acquired cases with indirect links to confirmed 
      COVID-19 cases. Diagnosis with COVID-19 was confirmed when throat swab samples 
      tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Approximately 34 686 individuals 
      live in Haiyu, including 2382 residents aged 65 years or older. Seven individuals 
      with COVID-19 acquired outside the community (age, 20-70 years; 3 [42%] women) were 
      moved from quarantine to a hospital for standard isolation treatment. A total of 20 
      people who were asymptomatic and who had had direct contact with these individuals 
      were closely observed by health care workers at a nearby hotel. Additionally, 800 
      individuals considered to be at higher risk were moved from quarantine to home 
      isolation for 14 days. There were no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 with 
      indirect links reported in the Haiyu community from the time that the study began on 
      January 23, 2020, to April 10, 2020. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings 
      suggest that cooperation among the authorities of multiple sectors allowed for the 
      implementation of preventive measures that were associated with limited community 
      transmission.

AB  - An unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei 
      province in China emerged in December 2019. A novel coronavirus was identified as 
      the causative agent and was subsequently termed COVID-19 by the World Health 
      Organization (WHO). Considered a relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is caused by a 
      betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 that affects the lower respiratory tract and 
      manifests as pneumonia in humans. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine 
      efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with 90,870 
      laboratory-confirmed cases and over 3,000 deaths worldwide. In response to this 
      global outbreak, we summarise the current state of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.

AB  - To discuss whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak constitutes a 
      Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), World Health Organization 
      (WHO) organized the 15-member International Health Regulations Emergency Committee 
      (EC). On January 22-23 and January 30, 2020, EC convened and discussed whether the 
      situation in China and other countries would constitute PHEIC and issued 
      recommendations for WHO, China and the international community. Based on the 
      recommendations of EC, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a PHEIC. One of the 
      purposes of the declaration of PHEIC was to alarm countries with weak public health 
      infrastructures to prepare promptly for emerging infectious diseases (EID) and 
      provide WHO with a framework for proactively supporting those countries. On February 
      3, 2020, WHO proposed the 2019 COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, 
      which includes accelerating research and development (R&amp;D) processes as one of three 
      major strategies. On February 11-12, 2020, WHO held the Global Research and 
      Innovation Forum: Towards a Research Roadmap for COVID-19. The fact that a COVID-19 
      R&amp;D forum was the first meeting convened after the PHEIC declaration testifies to 
      the importance of R&amp;D in response to EID. Korea has demonstrated a remarkable 
      capacity in its laboratory response by conducting high-throughput COVID-19 testing 
      and utilizing innovative drive-through samplings. These measures for early detection 
      and screening of cases should be followed by full efforts to produce research-based 
      evidence by thoroughly analyzing epidemiological, clinical and immunological data, 
      which will facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. It 
      is expected that Korea plays a global partner for COVID-19 research by actively 
      participating in immediate and mid/long-term priorities jointly led by WHO and 
      global partners.

TI  - Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control 
      COVID-19: a rapid review.
PG  - CD013574

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease that 
      has been classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support 
      WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the 
      effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks. OBJECTIVES: We 
      conducted a rapid review to assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in 
      combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed cases 
      of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in 
      regions with high transmission of the disease. SEARCH METHODS: An information 
      specialist searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and 
      CINAHL on 12 February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020. WHO provided 
      records from daily searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020. SELECTION 
      CRITERIA: Cohort studies, case-control-studies, case series, time series, 
      interrupted time series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect 
      of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS 
      (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as 
      indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review 
      author screened the remaining 70%. Two review authors screened all potentially 
      relevant full-text publications independently. One review author extracted data and 
      assessed evidence quality with GRADE and a second review author checked the 
      assessment. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: 
      incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      included 29 studies; 10 modelling studies on COVID-19, four observational studies 
      and 15 modelling studies on SARS and MERS. Because of the diverse methods of 
      measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a 
      meta-analysis and conducted a narrative synthesis. Due to the type of evidence found 
      for this review, GRADE rates the certainty of the evidence as low to very low. 
      Modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine 
      measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases 
      averted 44% to 81% incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths compared to no measures 
      based on different scenarios (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS; 
      mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS, low-certainty evidence). Very 
      low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are 
      implemented, the greater the cost savings (2 modelling studies on SARS). Very 
      low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a 
      country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths was small (2 
      modelling studies on SARS). When the models combined quarantine with other 
      prevention and control measures, including school closures, travel restrictions and 
      social distancing, the models demonstrated a larger effect on the reduction of new 
      cases, transmissions and deaths than individual measures alone (incident cases: 4 
      modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; 
      mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS 
      and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19. AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence for COVID-19 is limited to modelling studies that make 
      parameter assumptions based on the current, fragmented knowledge. Findings 
      consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and 
      mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early implementation of quarantine and 
      combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure 
      effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision 
      makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures 
      implemented. Testing in representative samples in different settings could help 
      assess the true prevalence of infection, and would reduce uncertainty of modelling 
      assumptions. This review was commissioned by WHO and supported by 
      Danube-University-Krems.

AB  - The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is named COVID-19. 
      This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly 
      elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This 
      is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 
      2002-2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with 
      about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying 
      degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that 
      this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in 
      Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as 
      potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals 
      and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. 
      Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and 
      confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread 
      of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human 
      transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have 
      prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier 
      recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even 
      more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the 
      nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear 
      that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant 
      challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the 
      virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects 
      globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of 
      Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.

TI  - Impact of household quarantine on SARS-Cov-2 infection in mainland China: A 
      mean-field modelling approach.
PG  - 4500-4512
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2020248 [doi]
AB  - The novel coronavirus, named SARS-Cov-2, has raged in mainland China for more than 
      three months, and it causes a huge threat to people's health and economic 
      development. In order to curb the SARS-Cov-2 prevalence, the Chinese government 
      enacted a series of containment strategies including household quarantine, traffic 
      restriction, city lockdowns etc. Indeed, the pandemic has been effectively 
      mitigated, but the global transmission is not still optimistic. Evaluating such 
      control measures in detail plays an important role in limiting SARS-Cov-2 spread for 
      public health decision and policymakers. In this paper, based on the cumulative 
      numbers of confirmed cases and deaths of SARS-Cov-2 infection, from January 31st to 
      March 31st, announced by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of 
      China, we established a mean-field model, considering the substantial contact change 
      under some restrictive measures, to study the dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 infection in 
      mainland China. By the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm of Markov Chain Monte 
      Carlo numerical method, our model provided a good fitting to the overall trends of 
      SARS-Cov-2 infections and discovers the transmission heterogeneities by some extreme 
      containment strategies to some extent. The basic reproduction number was 
      approximated to be 2.05 (95% CI [1.35,2.87]); the hospitalized cases arrived at the 
      peak of 29766 (95% CI [29743,29868]) on February 7th (95% CI [Feb.6th, Feb.8th]). 
      Importantly, we identified that the highest risk group of SARS-Cov-2 was the family 
      of four, which has the biggest probability of degree distributions at such node, 
      suggesting that contact patterns play an important role in curtailing the disease 
      spread.

TI  - A Practical Approach to the Management of Cancer Patients During the Novel 
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An International Collaborative Group.
PG  - e936-e945
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2020-0213 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread globally 
      since being identified as a public health emergency of major international concern 
      and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 
      December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified 
      in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human 
      transmission. Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and 
      disease surveillance. They may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy 
      or anticancer therapy and are at higher risk of developing infections. Several 
      factors increase the risk of infection, and cancer patients commonly have multiple 
      risk factors. Cancer patients appear to have an estimated twofold increased risk of 
      contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the WHO declaring the novel 
      coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of 
      such a pandemic on cancer patients. This include changes to resource allocation, 
      clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to 
      limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the management of 
      cancer patients in any infectious pandemic. In this review, the potential challenges 
      associated with managing cancer patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic will 
      be addressed, with suggestions of some practical approaches. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: The main management strategies for treating cancer patients during the 
      COVID-19 epidemic include clear communication and education about hand hygiene, 
      infection control measures, high-risk exposure, and the signs and symptoms of 
      COVID-19. Consideration of risk and benefit for active intervention in the cancer 
      population must be individualized. Postponing elective surgery or adjuvant 
      chemotherapy for cancer patients with low risk of progression should be considered 
      on a case-by-case basis. Minimizing outpatient visits can help to mitigate exposure 
      and possible further transmission. Telemedicine may be used to support patients to 
      minimize number of visits and risk of exposure. More research is needed to better 
      understand SARS-CoV-2 virology and epidemiology.

AB  - On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports of 
      pneumonia cases of unknown etiology in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. 
      The agent responsible was subsequently identified as a coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2. The 
      WHO declared this disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern at 
      the end of January 2020. This event evoked a sense of déjà vu, as it has many 
      similarities to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of 
      2002-2003. Both illnesses were caused by a zoonotic novel coronavirus, both 
      originated during winter in China and both spread rapidly all over the world. 
      However, the case-fatality rate of SARS (9.6%) is higher than that of COVID-19 
      (&lt;4%). Another zoonotic novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, was responsible for the Middle 
      East respiratory syndrome, which had a case-fatality rate of 34%. Our experiences in 
      coping with the previous coronavirus outbreaks have better equipped us to face the 
      challenges posed by COVID-19, especially in the health care setting. Among the 
      insights gained from the past outbreaks were: outbreaks caused by viruses are 
      hazardous to healthcare workers; the impact of the disease extends beyond the 
      infection; general principles of prevention and control are effective in containing 
      the disease; the disease poses both a public health as well as an occupational 
      health threat; and emerging infectious diseases pose a continuing threat to the 
      world. Given the perspectives gained and lessons learnt from these past events, we 
      should be better prepared to face the current COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed many areas of public health 
      preparedness that are lacking, especially in lower- and middle-income countries. 
      Digital interventions provide many opportunities for strengthening health systems 
      and could be vital resources in the current public health emergency. We provide 
      several use cases for infection control, home-based diagnosis and screening, 
      empowerment through information, public health surveillance and epidemiology, and 
      leveraging crowd-sourced data. A thoughtful, concerted effort-leveraging existing 
      experience and robust enterprise-grade technologies-can have a substantive impact on 
      the immediate and distal consequences of COVID-19.

TI  - The First 75 Days of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Outbreak: Recent Advances, 
      Prevention, and Treatment.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17072323 [doi]
LID - 2323
AB  - The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously 
      known as 2019-nCoV) outbreak has engulfed an unprepared world amidst a festive 
      season. The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is 
      the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus. Specifically, the overall genome 
      sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed 
      BatCoV RaTG13. Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than 
      that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is 
      highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of 
      up to 24 days. Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected 
      patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases. Since the first reported case 
      of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, 
      in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 
      fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020. The outbreak 
      has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels. This 
      paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to 
      respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days. Although no vaccines have been 
      discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various 
      governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst 
      various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected 
      patients. On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined 
      antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate. This review aims to 
      critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as 
      well as the strategies in prevention and treatment.

TI  - Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of heart transplant recipients during the 
      2019 coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China: A descriptive survey report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) 
      recipients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      epidemic remains unclear. We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients from 
      December 20, 2019, to February 25, 2020, in an effort to understand their risk and 
      outcomes. METHODS: All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center 
      retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based 
      questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS: We followed 87 HTx 
      recipients (72.4% were men, and the average age was 51 years). A total of 79 
      recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan-related history of travel 
      or contact. Most took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious 
      crowds, and 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and 
      quarantine procedures. Four upper airway infections were reported, and 3 of them 
      tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the fourth recovered and was not tested). All cases 
      were mild and successfully recovered after proper treatment. Laboratory results of 
      47 HTx cases within the last 2 months were extracted. Of these, 21.3% of recipients 
      had pre-existing lymphopenia, and 87.2% of recipients had a therapeutic 
      concentration of tacrolimus (5-12 ng/ml). Liver and kidney insufficiency was seen in 
      5 and 6 recipients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTx recipients who practiced 
      appropriate prevention measures had a low rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 
      transition to the associated disease COVID-19. These early data will require 
      confirmation as the pandemic establishes around the world.

AB  - COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020, the first non-influenza 
      pandemic, affecting more than 200 countries and areas, with more than 5·9 million 
      cases by May 31, 2020. Countries have developed strategies to deal with the COVID-19 
      pandemic that fit their epidemiological situations, capacities, and values. We 
      describe China's strategies for prevention and control of COVID-19 (containment and 
      suppression) and their application, from the perspective of the COVID-19 experience 
      to date in China. Although China has contained severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and nearly stopped indigenous transmission, a strong 
      suppression effort must continue to prevent re-establishment of community 
      transmission from importation-related cases. We believe that case finding and 
      management, with identification and quarantine of close contacts, are vitally 
      important containment measures and are essential in China's pathway forward. We 
      describe the next steps planned in China that follow the containment effort. We 
      believe that sharing countries' experiences will help the global community manage 
      the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying what works in the struggle against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Association of Public Health Interventions With the Epidemiology of the COVID-19 
      Outbreak in Wuhan, China.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and it is 
      unknown whether a combination of public health interventions can improve control of 
      the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of public health interventions 
      with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods 
      according to key events and interventions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In 
      this cohort study, individual-level data on 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 
      cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the 
      municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients' age, sex, 
      residential location, occupation, and severity classification. EXPOSURES: 
      Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic 
      restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and 
      universal symptom survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of laboratory-confirmed 
      COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), 
      across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 
      8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to 
      the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic 
      restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and 
      treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey). The effective 
      reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also 
      calculated over the periods. RESULTS: Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 
      cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 
      43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in 
      the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age 
      groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued 
      to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health 
      care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that 
      in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The 
      proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 
      periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 
      years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (≥80 years) 
      had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk 
      ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (&lt;20 years) had a lower risk 
      (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction 
      number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 
      6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with 
      improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. These findings may inform 
      public health policy in other countries and regions.

AB  - The transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan and Hubei Province differ considerably from those in the rest 
      of China. In Hubei province SARS-CoV‑2 led to a dramatic outbreak. Intensive control 
      measures (travel restrictions, isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts and 
      others) led to the control of the outbreak. Despite travel restrictions SARS-CoV‑2 
      was detected in other provinces in the following weeks. Consistent and intensive 
      identification and isolation of infected persons ("containment") was able to prevent 
      an outbreak outside Hubei province, providing an example for the control of 
      SARS-CoV‑2.

      global health threats: what lessons have we learned?
PG  - 717-726

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and 
      identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a 
      critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their 
      spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, 
      as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in 
      Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
      (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained 
      information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, 
      transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. 
      Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment 
      regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within 
      China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China 
      and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has 
      spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the 
      epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of 
      China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting 
      flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the 
      massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate 
      throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not 
      learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with 
      the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to 
      address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for 
      mapping the spread of infection.

AB  - An outbreak of severe pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in December 2019 in 
      Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The infectious virus was soon identified and named as 
      2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The name of the COVID-19 was given by WHO on 11 
      February 2020. It has so far caused about 118 000 cases in 114 countries including 
      China ending March 10, and was characterized as a pandemic by WHO on March 11. We 
      still face great challenges in control of the epidemic: uncertain initial source of 
      infection, infected populations widely scattered, complex routs of transmission, 
      populations generally susceptible, high contagiousness of the virus, and finally 
      vaccines unlikely available in the near future.

AB  - An epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans, which appeared in Wuhan, China 
      in December 2019, was caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This disease was 
      named as "Coronavirus Disease 2019" (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 was first identified as 
      an etiological pathogen of COVID-19, belonging to the species of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV). The speed of both the 
      geographical transmission and the sudden increase in numbers of cases is much faster 
      than SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). COVID-19 is the first global 
      pandemic caused by a coronavirus, which outbreaks in 211 
      countries/territories/areas. The vaccine against COVID-19, regarded as an effective 
      prophylactic strategy for control and prevention, is being developed in about 90 
      institutions worldwide. The experiences and lessons encountered in the previous SARS 
      and MERS vaccine research can be used for reference in the development of COVID-19 
      vaccine. The present paper hopes to provide some insights for COVID-19 vaccines 
      researchers.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease was first detected in Wuhan, the 
      capital of China's Hubei province, in December 2019 and has since spread globally, 
      especially to Europe and North America, resulting in the ongoing global coronavirus 
      pandemic disaster of 2019-2020. Although most cases have mild symptoms, there is 
      some progression to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure and death. More than 4.6 
      million cases have been registered across 216 countries and territories as of 19 
      April 2020, resulting in more than 311,000 deaths. Risk to communities with 
      continued widespread disease transmission depends on characteristics of the virus, 
      including how well it spreads between people; the severity of resulting illness; and 
      the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for 
      example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness) and the relative 
      success of these. In the absence of vaccines or medications, non-pharmaceutical 
      interventions were the most important response strategy based on community 
      interventions such as person-to-person distancing, mask-wearing, isolation and good 
      personal hygiene (hand-washing)-all of which have been demonstrated can reduce the 
      impact of this seemingly unstoppable globally spreading natural disaster. This paper 
      presents the results of quantitative research regarding the level of citizen 
      preparedness for disasters caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Serbia. The 
      survey was conducted using a questionnaire that was requested and then collected 
      online among 975 respondents during disaster in April 2020. The questionnaire 
      examined citizens' basic socio-economic and demographic characteristics, their 
      knowledge, preparedness, risk perception and preventive measures taken individually 
      and as a community to prevent the death and widespread transmission of novel 
      coronavirus disease 2019 in the Republic of Serbia. Based on the findings that there 
      are major differences in the public's perception of risks posed by communicable 
      disease threats such as presented by COVID-19, emergency management agencies should 
      use these differences to develop targeted strategies to enhance community and 
      national preparedness by promoting behavioral change and improving risk management 
      decision-making.

AB  - The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as named by the 
      World Health Organization has millions of confirmed cases around the world and has 
      claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 in February 
      by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. COVID-19 presents as fever, dry 
      cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia. In a small subset of severe cases, the 
      disease quickly progresses to respiratory failure and even death. Since the 21st 
      century, there have been three major outbreaks caused by human coronaviruses, 
      including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that broke out in 2003, the 
      Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the recent pandemic of 
      COVID-19. Since 2003, significant progress has been made in the study of SARS-CoV 
      and MERS-CoV concerning their natural origins, pathogenesis, antiviral development 
      and vaccine design. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, previous 
      findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better understanding as well as 
      diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we 
      highlight recent progresses in the field; compare the biological characteristics of 
      SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, 
      prevention and control options; and provide future perspectives for the outcome of 
      the outbreak and research questions to be answered, including some of the 
      difficulties in vaccine development. Hopefully, our comments and suggestions would 
      prove useful for the control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China and the world.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 originally emerged in Wuhan in December 
      2019. As of March 22, 2020, the disease spread to 186 countries, with at least 
      305,275 confirmed cases. Although there has been a decline in the spread of the 
      disease in China, the prevalence of COVID-19 around the world remains serious 
      despite containment efforts undertaken by national authorities and the international 
      community. In this article, we systematically review the brief history of COVID-19 
      and its epidemic and clinical characteristics, highlighting the strategies used to 
      control and prevent the disease in China, which may help other countries respond to 
      the outbreak. This pandemic emphasizes the need to be constantly alert to shifts in 
      both the global dynamics and the contexts of individual countries, making sure that 
      all are aware of which approaches are successful for the prevention, containment and 
      treatment of new diseases, and being flexible enough to adapt the responses 
      accordingly.

TI  - Efficacy of Mass Quarantine as Leverage of Health System Governance During COVID-19 
      Outbreak: A Mini Policy Review.
PG  - 265-267
LID - 10.34172/aim.2020.08 [doi]
AB  - On January 23, 2020, the Chinese government announced the city lockdown of Wuhan. 
      Since then, there have been controversial debates among experts about the efficacy 
      of mass quarantine, the oldest and probably one of the most effective methods for 
      controlling infectious disease outbreaks. The impact of health policymaking section 
      of health system governance becomes visible to all stakeholders and the public in 
      such emergency contexts. The success and failure of such policies should be 
      evaluated in order to find the proper course of action for the local and 
      international communities. In this review, we aim to investigate the efficacy of 
      mass quarantine in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We 
      found good quality evidence for the effectiveness of mass quarantine during the 
      current stage of COVID-19 pandemic, and these strategies seem to have been highly 
      effective in controlling the spread of the disease.

AB  - In a short span, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has captured global consciousness 
      by significantly affecting the day-to-day life of humans and emerged as a public 
      health emergency. Undoubtedly, it indicates that lessons learnt from the past 
      epidemics of coronaviruses such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and 
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), had not enough and thus left us 
      ill-prepared to deal with the challenges that COVID-19 pandemic is currently posing. 
      Currently, as a global pandemic, COVID-19 poses major challenges and thus forcing 
      the entire world to lockdown. However, the disease has prepared humankind in facing 
      such outbreaks at present as well as in the future. Besides, it has also taught 
      numerous lessons that are worth considering and implementing to make the world a 
      better reality.

AB  - In the past five months, success in control the national epidemic of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been witnessed in China. The implementation of public 
      health measures accounts for the success which include different interventions in 
      the early or later stages of the outbreak. It is clear that although not all 
      measures were universally effective worldwide, their achievements have been 
      significant. More solidarity is needed to deal with this global pandemic with more 
      learning and understanding. Understanding which of the public health interventions 
      implemented in China were effective may provide ideas for international epidemic 
      control.

AB  - Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary 
      between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A novel coronavirus was 
      identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus 
      represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus 
      is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 
      the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World 
      Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic 
      in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the 
      incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 
      laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific 
      medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and 
      pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat 
      the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge 
      about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an 
      antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now 
      approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and 
      hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were 
      recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for 
      treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under 
      investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for 
      COVID-19. The first COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be ready for clinical trials 
      before the end of the year.

TI  - Preparedness and Responses Faced during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Belgium: An 
      Observational Study and Using the National Open Data.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17217985 [doi]
LID - 7985
AB  - This study aimed to descript the Belgian COVID-19 responses process according to the 
      WHO's (World Health Organization) Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management 
      Framework (Health EDRM Framework) and to present the measures taken and epidemic 
      impact in the different phases of COVID-19 in Belgium. The WHO's EDRM Framework was 
      used for reviewing the Belgian Public health emergency preparedness and responses in 
      the context of COVID-19. Information on the measures taken was collected through the 
      literature review including all government's communication, reports, and scientific 
      papers. All epidemic data were extracted from a national open database managed and 
      published by the Sciensano. Additionally, two authors closely followed the Belgian 
      situation since the beginning of the pandemic and updated the data every day. During 
      the COVID-19 pandemic, the anti-epidemic strategy was mainly to avoid medical 
      resources exceeding the upper limit. Belgium issued a series of emergency decrees to 
      limit the spread of the virus. An existing structure of "federal-region-municipal" 
      as the framework of public health emergency preparedness and response was adapted. 
      The emergency response process in Belgium was divided into four phases: 
      information-evaluation-coordination-decision-making at the region level and the 
      final decision-making at the federal level. Belgium also implemented a phased plan 
      in the process of setting up and lifting the lockdown. However, it was vulnerable in 
      early response, due to the shortage of medical equipment supplies in general, and 
      more particularly for the long term care facilities (LTCFs). Belgium has achieved an 
      intensive cooperation between stakeholders based on an existing multisectoral 
      emergency organization framework. Legislation, medical insurance, and good 
      communication also played a role in limiting the spread of viruses. However, the 
      authorities underestimated the risk of an epidemic and did not take quarantine 
      measures among people suspected affected by SARS-COV-2 in the early stages, 
      resulting in insufficient medical equipment supply and a large number of deaths in 
      the LTCF. The implementation of the lockdown measure in Belgium also encountered 
      obstacles. The lockdown and its exit strategy were both closely related to the 
      pandemic situation and social and economic life. The authorities should strengthen 
      information management, improve the public awareness of the measures, and find out 
      the balance points between the social and economic life and infection control 
      measures.

AB  - BackgroundEstimating key infectious disease parameters from the coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19) outbreak is essential for modelling studies and guiding intervention 
      strategies.AimWe estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of 
      pre-symptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of COVID-19. We 
      illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates 
      can be biased.MethodsWe used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, 
      China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while 
      acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the 
      underlying transmission network. From those estimates, we obtained the serial 
      interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction 
      numbers.ResultsThe mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95% credible interval 
      (CrI): 3.78-6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95% CrI: 3.01-4.91) for Tianjin. The 
      proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95% CrI: 32-67) for Singapore 
      and 62% (95% CrI: 50-76) for Tianjin. Reproduction number estimates based on the 
      generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial 
      interval distribution. Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities 
      from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information.ConclusionHigh 
      estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding 
      and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order 
      to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, quarantine and other containment measures 
      were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the 
      proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.

AB  - In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, 
      China. On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in the throat swab sample of one 
      patient. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the epidemic disease caused 
      by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, COVID-19 has spread 
      widely around the world, affecting more than seventy countries. China, with a huge 
      burden of this disease, has taken strong measures to control the spread and improve 
      the curative rate of COVID-19. In this review, we summarized the epidemiological 
      characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19. 
      A comprehensive understanding will help to control the disease.

TI  - Travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review.
PG  - CD013717
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD013717 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In late 2019, first cases of coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, 
      caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were reported in Wuhan, China. 
      Subsequently COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing 
      pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to 
      international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry 
      or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the 
      effectiveness of travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on 
      infectious disease and screening-related outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched 
      MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the WHO Global Database 
      on COVID-19 Research, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID-19 
      Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward-citation searches with 
      existing reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered experimental, 
      quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of 
      travel-related control measures affecting human travel across national borders 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect 
      evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in 
      epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious 
      disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and 
      adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author screened titles and abstracts; all 
      excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently 
      screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and 
      appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for 
      correctness of all data reported in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, quality appraisal 
      and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, 
      we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for 
      observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS-I for observational 
      ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings 
      narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the 
      review author team discussed ratings. MAIN RESULTS: We included 40 records reporting 
      on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening 
      studies and one observational ecological study on COVID-19, four modelling and six 
      observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a 
      variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel-related 
      control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure 
      was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator 
      scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of 
      measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the 
      risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially 
      inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and 
      failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening 
      studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening 
      process. Studies on COVID-19 Travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel Eleven 
      studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational 
      ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      Very low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at 
      the beginning of the outbreak, cross-border travel restrictions may lead to a 
      reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies), the number 
      of deaths (1 study), the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies), the 
      risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies), and the effective reproduction 
      number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study). Low-certainty evidence 
      from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported 
      cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies), and in the growth acceleration of epidemic 
      progression (1 study). Screening at borders with or without quarantine Evidence from 
      three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine 
      suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low-certainty 
      evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% 
      (low-certainty evidence). Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were 
      conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. 
      Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom 
      screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, 
      and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 
      14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the 
      screening approach), and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very 
      low-certainty evidence). The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to 
      both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the 
      travellers screened; for example, symptom-based screening alone generally performed 
      worse than a combination of symptom-based and PCR screening with subsequent 
      observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellers Evidence from one modelling 
      study simulating a 14-day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases 
      seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of 
      quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled 
      between 70% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: With much 
      of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions 
      reducing cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 
      'real-life' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for 
      most travel-related control measures is very low and the true effects may be 
      substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel-related 
      control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on 
      infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of 
      disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their 
      own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to 
      prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent 
      quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. 
      There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of 
      travel-related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that 
      effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the 
      interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community 
      transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.

TI  - Containing COVID-19 Among 627,386 Persons in Contact With the Diamond Princess 
      Cruise Ship Passengers Who Disembarked in Taiwan: Big Data Analytics.
PG  - e19540
LID - 10.2196/19540 [doi]
LID - e19540
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low infection and case-fatality rates have been thus far observed in 
      Taiwan. One of the reasons for this major success is better use of big data 
      analytics in efficient contact tracing and management and surveillance of those who 
      require quarantine and isolation. OBJECTIVE: We present here a unique application of 
      big data analytics among Taiwanese people who had contact with more than 3000 
      passengers that disembarked at Keelung harbor in Taiwan for a 1-day tour on January 
      31, 2020, 5 days before the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the 
      Diamond Princess cruise ship on February 5, 2020, after an index case was identified 
      on January 20, 2020. METHODS: The smart contact tracing-based mobile sensor data, 
      cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data, were analyzed by the mobile 
      geopositioning method and rapid analysis to identify 627,386 potential 
      contact-persons. Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via 
      SMS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were 
      offered for symptomatic contacts. National Health Insurance claims big data were 
      linked, to follow-up on the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were 
      hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to undergo screening for SARS-CoV-2. 
      RESULTS: As of February 29, a total of 67 contacts who were tested by reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 
      cases were found. Less cases of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia were found after 
      the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until 
      March 10, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Big data analytics with smart contact tracing, 
      automated alert messaging for self-restriction, and follow-up of the outcome related 
      to COVID-19 using health insurance data could curtail the resources required for 
      conventional epidemiological contact tracing.

AB  - Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome 
      infecting animals and humans. Coronaviruses have been described more than 70 years 
      ago and contain many species. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle 
      East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are lethal species caused by human coronaviruses 
      (HCoVs). Currently, a novel strain of HCoVs, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). SARS-CoV-2 
      was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei 
      province of China, and has since spread worldwide causing an outbreak in more than 
      200 countries. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 
      and a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in late January 2020 
      by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract 
      causing flu-like symptoms and, in some, may cause severe illness like pneumonia and 
      multi-organ failure leading to death. Today, Covid-19 cases almost reaching 9 
      million, with more than 450 thousand deaths. There is an urgent demand for 
      developing a vaccine since no effective therapies or vaccines have been approved to 
      this day to prevent or minimize the spread of the infection. In this review, we 
      summarized the furthest vaccines in the clinical pipeline.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a tremendous impact in China and abroad 
      since its onset in December 2019 and poses a major threat to human health. 
      Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of the response to outbreaks. This 
      study reviewed literature data and found that HCWs were at high risk of infection 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially at the early stage of the epidemic, and 
      many factors greatly affected their occupational safety. Although SARS-CoV-2 
      transmission was controlled in China, the Chinese experience can help protect HCWs 
      from COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.

AB  - With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new 
      coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aroused 
      the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections with 
      SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health 
      Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of 
      International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections-SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle 
      East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-both caused severe respiratory syndrome in 
      humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are 
      caused by β-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower 
      respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is 
      still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of 
      labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found 
      among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen 
      especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and 
      understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through 
      blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation 
      methods on coronaviruses.

TI  - Challenges to the system of reserve medical supplies for public health emergencies: 
      reflections on the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in China.
PG  - 3-8
LID - 10.5582/bst.2020.01043 [doi]
AB  - On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced an outbreak of 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), China is now at a 
      critical period in the control of the epidemic. The Chinese Government has been 
      taking a series of rapid, comprehensive, and effective prevention and control 
      measures. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a 
      serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage of 
      personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing. This is 
      one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention and control. 
      Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to quickly respond 
      to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and it has clarified 
      requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the emergency reserve 
      supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and there are also 
      deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency medical supplies. 
      A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the management of public 
      health emergencies. Based on international experiences with pandemic control, the 
      world should emphasize improving the system of emergency reserve medical supplies in 
      the process of establishing and improving public health emergency response systems, 
      and it should promote the establishment of international cooperative programs to 
      jointly deal with public health emergencies of international concern in the future.

AB  - After the initial outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (now called COVID-19)-in 
      Wuhan, China-and its subsequent fast dispersion throughout the world, many questions 
      regarding its pathogenesis, genetic evolution, prevention, and transmission routes 
      remain unanswered but fast explored. More than 100,000 confirmed, infected cases 
      within a relatively short period of time globally corroborated the presumption that 
      a pandemic will develop; such a pandemic will require a suite of global intervention 
      measures. Consequently, different countries have reacted differently to the COVID-19 
      outbreak, but a uniform global response is necessary for tackling the pandemic. 
      Managing the present or future COVID-19 outbreaks is not impossible but surely 
      difficult. Barring the live-animal trade at the markets; revising the regulations 
      and rules of customs, import or export across borders; supporting and expediting 
      projects to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs; immediate quarantine of the 
      involved regions; and also producing and supplying a large number of protective 
      facemasks and preventing its stockpiling or smuggling are the main actions suggested 
      to deal with the present or a forthcoming COVID-19 outbreaks. Increasing numbers of 
      infected cases had heightened concerns about the public health and welfare. Thus, 
      preparing for the next probable pandemic of COVID-19 demands scrutinization of the 
      lessons we have learnt so far.

AB  - SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an 
      infectious respiratory disease causing thousands of deaths and overwhelming public 
      health systems. The international spread of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the ease 
      of global travel, and societal dynamics, immunologic naiveté of the host population, 
      and muted innate immune responses. Based on these factors and the expanding 
      geographic scale of the disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 
      COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic-the first caused by a coronavirus. In this review, we 
      summarize the current epidemiological status of COVID-19 and consider the 
      virological and immunological lessons, animal models, and tools developed in 
      response to prior SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks that can serve as resources for 
      development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines. In particular, we discuss 
      structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a major determinant of 
      transmissibility, and discuss key molecular aspects that will aid in understanding 
      and fighting this new global threat.

TI  - Epidemiological characteristics of the first 100 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, a city with a 
      stringent containment policy.
PG  - 1096-1105

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hong Kong (HK) is a densely populated city near the epicentre of the 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Stringent border control together with 
      aggressive case finding, contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine measures 
      were implemented to halt the importation and spread of the virus. METHODS: We 
      performed an epidemiological study using government information covering the first 
      100 confirmed cases to examine the epidemic curve, incidence, clusters, reproduction 
      number (Rt), incubation period and time to containment. RESULTS: A total of 93 of 
      the 100 cases were HK residents (6 infected in Mainland China, 10 on the Diamond 
      Princess Cruise). Seven were visitors infected in Mainland China before entering HK. 
      The majority (76%) were aged ≥45 years, and the incidence increased with age 
      (P &lt; 0.001). Escalation of border control measures correlated with a decrease in the 
      proportion (62.5% to 0%) of cases imported from Mainland China, and a reduction in 
      Rt (1.07 to 0.75). The median incubation period was 4.2 days [95% confidence 
      interval (CI), 4.0-4.5; 5th and 95th percentiles: 1.3 and 14.0). Most clusters with 
      identifiable epidemiological links were households involving 2-4 people. Three 
      medium-spreading events were identified: two from New Year gatherings (6-11 people), 
      and another from environmental contamination of a worship hall (12 people). Despite 
      intensified contact tracing, containment was delayed in 78.9% of cases 
      (mean = 5.96 days, range = 0-24 days). An unusual transmission in a multi-storey 
      building via faulty toilet plumbing was suspected with &gt;100 residents evacuated 
      overnight. Our analysis indicated that faulty plumbing was unlikely to be the source 
      of this transmission. CONCLUSION: Timely stringent containment policies minimized 
      the importation and transmission of COVID-19 in HK.

AB  - Since the first accounts of SARS-CoV-2, authorities have encountered numerous 
      unprecedented situations threatening public health. This rapid communication 
      addresses events that led to the quarantining of a hotel in Tenerife, Spain and the 
      effectiveness of the rapidly implemented control measures. In total, eight cases 
      have been associated with the hotel. Due to the international nature of the guests, 
      had these timely precautions not been in place, a multinational cluster might have 
      formed.

      cases in China.
PG  - 742-746
LID - 10.1126/science.abb4557 [doi]
AB  - The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China was 
      characterized by a distinctive subexponential increase of confirmed cases during the 
      early phase of the epidemic, contrasting with an initial exponential growth expected 
      for an unconstrained outbreak. We show that this effect can be explained as a direct 
      consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible 
      population. To this end, we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both 
      quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals, as well as population-wide isolation 
      practices in response to containment policies or behavioral changes, and show that 
      the model captures the observed growth behavior accurately. The insights provided 
      here may aid the careful implementation of containment strategies for ongoing 
      secondary outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar future outbreaks of other emergent 
      infectious diseases.

AB  - A new outbreak of respiratory infection caused by the novel coronavirus in late 
      December 2019 in China caused standards of medical care to change not only for 
      related areas but for the entire healthcare system, and when the WHO declared 
      COVID-19 a pandemic new strategies of patient care had to be defined initially to 
      optimize resources to confront the pandemic and then to protect healthcare 
      personnel. As urologists, we must be involved in these new standards, since without 
      an effective vaccine the risk of contagion is high; thus, the purpose of this review 
      is to have orientation on the measures urologists should take in their everyday 
      clinical practice.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease Pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in December 2019 in 
      China. SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted by droplet infection. After an incubation 
      period of 1-14 days, COVID-19 shows a mild course in 80 % of observed cases and a 
      severe course in 20 %, with a lethality rate of 0.3-5.8 %. Elderly people and people 
      with underlying diseases have a higher risk of severe courses with mandatory 
      ventilation. So far there are neither effective drugs nor vaccinations available, so 
      only public health interventions such as physical distancing and hygiene measures on 
      the one hand and targeted testing followed by isolation and quarantine measures on 
      the other hand are available. China has shown that maximum use of these measures can 
      control the epidemic. The further course and also the consequences for the global 
      economy cannot be clearly predicted at present.

AB  - There is an obvious concern globally regarding the fact about the emerging 
      coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a worldwide public health threat. 
      As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available 
      epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and 
      intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, caused by the 
      SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this 
      novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe. In 
      this study, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak 
      information on COVID-19 based on the several open datasets on 2019-nCoV provided by 
      the Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease 
      Control and Prevention, National Health Commission, and DXY. An exploratory data 
      analysis with visualizations has been made to understand the number of different 
      cases reported (confirmed, death, and recovered) in different provinces of China and 
      outside of China. Overall, at the outset of an outbreak like this, it is highly 
      important to readily provide information to begin the evaluation necessary to 
      understand the risks and begin containment activities.

AB  - The outbreak of emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) in China has been brought to global attention and 
      declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. 
      Scientific advancements since the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS) in 2002~2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 have 
      accelerated our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and 
      the development of therapeutics to treat viral infection. As no specific 
      therapeutics and vaccines are available for disease control, the epidemic of 
      COVID-19 is posing a great threat for global public health. To provide a 
      comprehensive summary to public health authorities and potential readers worldwide, 
      we detail the present understanding of COVID-19 and introduce the current state of 
      development of measures in this review.

AB  - After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in November 2002, 
      coronaviruses (CoVs) received worldwide attention. On December 1, 2019, the first 
      case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus 
      (SARS-CoV-2), was reported in Wuhan, China, and CoVs returned to public view. On 
      January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the COVID-19 
      epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and on March 
      11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic disease. As of July 31, 2020, 
      COVID-19 has affected 216 countries and regions, with 17,064,064 confirmed cases and 
      668,073 deaths, and the number of new cases has been increasing daily. Additionally, 
      on March 19, 2020, there were no new confirmed cases in China, providing hope and 
      valuable experience for the international community. In this review, we 
      systematically compare COVID-19 and SARS in terms of epidemiology, pathogenesis and 
      clinical characteristics and discuss the current treatment approaches, scientific 
      advancements and Chinese experience in fighting the epidemic to combat the novel 
      coronavirus pandemic. We also discuss the lessons that we have learned from COVID-19 
      and SARS.

      China. Nepal shares open border with India from three sides, east, south and west. 
      And, in north with China, where the novel coronavirus infection (CVOVID-19) began in 
      late December 2019. The first confirmed imported case in Nepal was reported in 2nd 
      week of January 2020. The initial response of Nepal to COVID-19 were comparably slow 
      but country geared efforts after it was declared a 'global pandemic' by WHO on 11 
      March, 2020. Government of Nepal's steps from 18 March, 2020 led to partial lock 
      down and countrywide lockdown imposed on 24 March, 2020. Government devised 
      comprehensive plan on 27 March, 2020 for quarantine for peoples who arrived in Nepal 
      from COVID-19 affected countries. This article covers summary of global status, 
      South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) status, and Nepal's response 
      to contain COVID-19 infection discussed under three headings: Steps taken before and 
      after WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and lab services regarding detection 
      of COVID-19. Nepal has documented five confirmed cases of COVID-19 till the end of 
      March 2020, first in second week of 15 January, 2020 and 2nd case 8-weeks thereafter 
      and 3rd case two days later, 4th on 27 March and 5th on 28 March. Four more cases 
      detected during first week of April. Non-Pharmacological interventions like social 
      distancing and excellent personal habits are widely practiced. Country has to 
      enhance testing and strengthen tracing, isolation and quarantine mechanism and care 
      of COVID-19 patients as Nepal is in risk zone because of comparably weak health 
      system and porous borders with India. The time will tell regarding further outbreak 
      and how it will be tackled. Keywords: COVID-19; lockdown; Nepal; pandemic; response.

      COVID-19: a modelling study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Voluntary individual quarantine and voluntary active monitoring of 
      contacts are core disease control strategies for emerging infectious diseases such 
      as COVID-19. Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it 
      is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively 
      control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important 
      to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible and broader mitigation 
      measures must be implemented. METHODS: To estimate the comparative efficacy of 
      individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts to control severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we fit a stochastic branching model 
      to reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Specifically, we fit a model 
      to the incubation period distribution (mean 5·2 days) and to two estimates of the 
      serial interval distribution: a shorter one with a mean serial interval of 4·8 days 
      and a longer one with a mean of 7·5 days. To assess variable resource settings, we 
      considered two feasibility settings: a high-feasibility setting with 90% of contacts 
      traced, a half-day average delay in tracing and symptom recognition, and 90% 
      effective isolation; and a low-feasibility setting with 50% of contacts traced, a 
      2-day average delay, and 50% effective isolation. FINDINGS: Model fitting by 
      sequential Monte Carlo resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset before 
      symptom onset of 0·77 days (95% CI -1·98 to 0·29) for the shorter serial interval, 
      and for the longer serial interval it resulted in a mean time of infectiousness 
      onset after symptom onset of 0·51 days (95% CI -0·77 to 1·50). Individual quarantine 
      in high-feasibility settings, where at least 75% of infected contacts are 
      individually quarantined, contains an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 with a short serial 
      interval (4·8 days) 84% of the time. However, in settings where the outbreak 
      continues to grow (eg, low-feasibility settings), so too will the burden of the 
      number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine, particularly 
      uninfected contacts (who never develop symptoms). When resources are prioritised for 
      scalable interventions such as physical distancing, we show active monitoring or 
      individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to 
      mitigation efforts. Even under the shorter serial interval, if physical distancing 
      reduces the reproductive number to 1·25, active monitoring of 50% of contacts can 
      result in overall outbreak control (ie, effective reproductive number &lt;1). 
      INTERPRETATION: Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial 
      interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission to make data-driven policy 
      decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine versus 
      active monitoring of contacts. To the extent that these interventions can be 
      implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. FUNDING: National

AB  - An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and 
      has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories, including the 
      United States (1). As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936 reported cases in 
      mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland China (1). There have 
      been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been reported in the United 
      States. Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 
      39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a 
      current total of 53 cases within the United States. This report summarizes the 
      aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local health departments, multiple 
      other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing to slow and try to 
      contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. These measures require the 
      identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States 
      and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from 
      areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission. Although these measures might not 
      prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being 
      implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare 
      state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational 
      organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission 
      occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations 
      and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including 
      diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. U.S. public health authorities are 
      monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World 
      Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners. Interim guidance is available 
      at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html. As more is learned about this novel 
      virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance 
      for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and 
      communities.

      resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada.
PG  - E1053-E1064
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.200990 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continual efforts to eliminate community transmission of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be needed to prevent additional 
      waves of infection. We explored the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on 
      projected SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada. METHODS: We developed an age-structured 
      agent-based model of the Canadian population simulating the impact of current and 
      projected levels of public health interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 
      Interventions included case detection and isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, 
      physical distancing and community closures, evaluated alone and in combination. 
      RESULTS: Without any interventions, 64.6% (95% credible interval [CrI] 63.9%-65.0%) 
      of Canadians will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (total attack rate) and 3.6% (95% CrI 
      2.4%-3.8%) of those infected and symptomatic will die. If case detection and contact 
      tracing continued at baseline levels without maintained physical distancing and 
      reimplementation of restrictive measures, this combination brought the total attack 
      rate to 56.1% (95% CrI 0.05%-57.1%), but it dropped to 0.4% (95% CrI 0.03%-23.5%) 
      with enhanced case detection and contact tracing. Combining the latter scenario with 
      maintained physical distancing reduced the total attack rate to 0.2% (95% CrI 
      0.03%-1.7%) and was the only scenario that consistently kept hospital and intensive 
      care unit bed use under capacity, prevented nearly all deaths and eliminated the 
      epidemic. Extending school closures had minimal effects but did reduce transmission 
      in schools; however, extending closures of workplaces and mixed-age venues markedly 
      reduced attack rates and usually or always eliminated the epidemic under any 
      scenario. INTERPRETATION: Controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission will depend on 
      enhancing and maintaining interventions at both the community and individual levels. 
      Without such interventions, a resurgent epidemic will occur, with the risk of 
      overwhelming our health care systems.

TI  - COVID-19 in Africa: care and protection for frontline healthcare workers.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/s12992-020-00574-3 [doi]
LID - 46
AB  - Medical staff caring for COVID-19 patients face mental stress, physical exhaustion, 
      separation from families, stigma, and the pain of losing patients and colleagues. 
      Many of them have acquired SARS-CoV-2 and some have died. In Africa, where the 
      pandemic is escalating, there are major gaps in response capacity, especially in 
      human resources and protective equipment. We examine these challenges and propose 
      interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles 
      identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means 
      that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost 
      interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for 
      handwashing may be challenging, as is 'physical distancing' in overcrowded primary 
      health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high 
      among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds 
      and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care 
      centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has 
      learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community 
      healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and 
      related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom 
      screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through 
      carefully managed risk 'allowances' or compensation. International support with 
      personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemic's 
      trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human 
      resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, 
      healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 
      policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for 
      SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that 
      public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers 
      may help to maintain morale. Clearly there are multiple ways that international 
      support and national commitment could help safeguard healthcare workers in Africa, 
      essential for limiting the pandemic's potentially devastating heath, socio-economic 
      and security impacts on the continent.

AB  - The world must act fast to contain wider international spread of the epidemic of 
      COVID-19 now. The unprecedented public health efforts in China have contained the 
      spread of this new virus. Measures taken in China are currently proven to reduce 
      human-to-human transmission successfully. We summarized the effective intervention 
      and prevention measures in the fields of public health response, clinical 
      management, and research development in China, which may provide vital lessons for 
      the global response. It is really important to take collaborative actions now to 
      save more lives from the pandemic of COVID-19.

LID - 2690
AB  - At the end of 2019 a novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2), causing severe acute respiratory syndrome expanded globally from 
      Wuhan, China. In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the SARS-Cov-2 
      virus a global pandemic. We performed a narrative review to describe existing 
      literature with regard to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiology, 
      pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and future perspective. MEDLINE, EMBASE and 
      Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles. Although only when the 
      pandemic ends it will be possible to assess the full health, social and economic 
      impact of this global disaster, this review represents a picture of the current 
      state of the art. In particular, we focus on public health impact, pathophysiology 
      and clinical manifestations, diagnosis, case management, emergency response and 
      preparedness.

TI  - Estimating the reproductive number and the outbreak size of COVID-19 in Korea.
PG  - e2020011

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the first novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient in 
      Korea was diagnosed on January 20, 2020, 30 patients were diagnosed until February 
      17, 2020. However, 5,298 additional patients were confirmed until March 4, 2020. 
      Therefore, our objective was to estimate the reproduction number (R) and evaluate 
      the effectiveness of preventive measures. METHODS: A COVID-19 transmission model 
      (SEIHR) was established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of daily confirmed 
      cases in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province (NGP), the main area of outbreak, was 
      used. The first patient' symptom onset date in the Daegu/NGP outbreak was assumed as 
      January 22, 2020. The R according to the start date of the effect of preventive 
      measures was estimated. RESULTS: The estimated R in Hubei Province, China, was 
      4.0281, whereas the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.555, but later in Daegu/NGP, 
      the value was between 3.472 and 3.543. When the transmission period decreases from 
      4-day to 2-day, the outbreak ends early, but the peak of the epidemic increases, and 
      the total number of patients does not change greatly. It was found that, if 
      transmission rate decreases, the outbreak ends early, and the size of the peak and 
      the total number of patients also decreases. CONCLUSIONS: To end the COVID-19 
      epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and 
      wearing masks, are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along 
      with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating 
      patients as quickly as possible through the efforts of the quarantine authorities.

AB  - An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently emerged and 
      rapidly spreading in humans causing a significant threat to international health and 
      the economy. Rapid assessment and warning are crucial for an outbreak analysis in 
      response to serious public health. SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequences 
      with SARS-CoVs causing highly lethal pneumonia with respiratory distress and 
      clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. 
      Notably, some COVID-19 patients also expressed neurologic signs like nausea, 
      headache, and vomiting. Several studies have reported that coronaviruses are not 
      only causing respiratory illness but also invade the central nervous system through 
      a synapse-connected route. SARS-CoV infections are reported in both patients and 
      experimental animals' brains. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients have shown the 
      presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their cerebrospinal fluid. Considering the 
      similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in various aspects, it remains to 
      clarify whether the potent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 may affect in COVID-19 patients. 
      All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the treatment and the 
      prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In the absence of potential 
      interventions for COVID-19, there is an urgent need for an alternative strategy to 
      control the spread of this disease.

AB  - Over the past two decades, there have been two major outbreaks where the crossover 
      of animal Betacoronaviruses to humans has resulted in severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      (MERS-CoV). In December 2019, a global public health concern started with the 
      emergence of a new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019 novel coronavirus, 
      2019-nCoV) which has rapidly spread all over the world from its origin in Wuhan, 
      China. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus, which includes human 
      SARS-CoV, MERS and two other human coronaviruses (HCoVs), HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. 
      The fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is lower than the two previous coronavirus 
      epidemics, but it is faster spreading and the large number of infected people with 
      severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness, showed SARS-CoV-2 to be highly 
      contagious. Based on the current published evidence, herein we summarize the origin, 
      genetics, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, preventions, diagnosis and up to 
      date treatments of SARS-CoV-2 infections in comparison with those caused by SARS-CoV 
      and MERS-CoV. Moreover, the possible impact of weather conditions on the 
      transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed. Therefore, the aim of the present 
      review is to reconsider the two previous pandemics and provide a reference for 
      future studies as well as therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Nearly four months have passed since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the rapidly spreading Coronavirus 
      Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, there have been more than 2.3 million 
      confirmed cases and more than 160,000 deaths globally caused by COVID-19. Chinese 
      health authorities, where the virus emerged, have taken prompt strict public health 
      measures to control and prevent the spread of the outbreak. In Saudi Arabia, 
      unprecedented precautionary strict measures were applied to prevent virus entry to 
      the country or to mitigate its impact when it arrives. Here, we review the response 
      of Saudi Arabia to COVID-19 pandemic and how did the experience learned from the 
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic since 2012 has 
      helped the country to be better prepared for the current COVID-19 pandemic. We also 
      discuss the country readiness, improvement in research and development, and the 
      unprecedented rapid precautionary measures that have been taken by the Saudi 
      government thus far.

TI  - How Shenzhen, China avoided widespread community transmission: a potential model for 
      successful prevention and control of COVID-19.

AB  - Shenzhen is a city of 22 million people in south China that serves as a financial 
      and trade center for East Asia. The city has extensive ties to Hubei Province, the 
      first reported epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the 
      world. Initial predictions suggested Shenzhen would experience a high number of 
      COVID-19 cases. These predictions have not materialized. As of 31 March 
      2020 Shenzhen had only 451 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Contact tracing has shown 
      that no cases were the result of community transmission within the city. While 
      Shenzhen did not implement a citywide lockdown like Wuhan, it did put into place a 
      rapid response system first developed after the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS) epidemic in 2003. In the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak, Shenzhen health 
      authority created a network for surveillance and responding to novel respiratory 
      infections, including pneumonia of unknown causes (PUC). The network rapidly 
      detected mass discussion about PUC and immediately deployed emergency preparedness, 
      quarantine for close contacts of PUC. Five early actions (early detection, early 
      reporting, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment) and four 
      centralized responses (centralized coordination by experts, centralized allocation 
      of resources, centralized placement of patients, and centralized provision of 
      treatment) ensured effective prevention and control. Tripartite working teams 
      comprising community cadres, medical personnel and police were formulated to conduct 
      contact tracing at each neighborhood and residential community. Incorporation of 
      mobile technology, big data, and artificial intelligence into COVID-19 response 
      increased accessibility to health services, reduced misinformation and minimized the 
      impact of fake news. Shenzhen's unique experience in successfully controlling the 
      COVID-19 outbreak may be a useful model for countries and regions currently 
      experiencing rapid spread of the virus.

AB  - Our first COVID-19 case in Turkey was a 44-year-old male who referred to the 
      hospital on March 9, 2020. The first related death occurred on March 17, 2020. 
      Preparedness for the pandemic has been ongoing before the first case was detected. 
      The National Pandemic Plan was published in 2006. The Pandemic Influenza National 
      Preparedness Plan was available after being updated in light of experiences gained 
      during the 2009 Influenza A pandemic. Accordingly, Pandemic Coordination Boards and 
      Operation Centers have been established on the national and provincial levels. This 
      was an adaptable plan to the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). We formed teams 
      to work on a 24/7 basis and established a Scientific Committee at the Public Health 
      Emergency Operation Center within the General Directorate of Public Health. 
      “COVID-19 Risk Assessment”, “COVID-19 Guideline” and “Case Report Form”, regulations 
      of personal protective equipment along with need-based guidelines, treatment 
      algorithms, brochures and related documents have been released. For the case-based 
      follow-up, Public Health Management System (HSYS) is being used. PCR and rapid 
      diagnostic kits are being used to analyze the samples at the central Microbiology 
      Reference Laboratory and the authorized laboratories in several provinces. Various 
      preventive measures were implemented including flight restrictions to certain 
      countries, gradually expanded to suspending all flights and prohibiting the entry of 
      foreign nationals, 14-day isolation and symptom monitoring for those that came from 
      countries under risk. Persons with chronic diseases have been granted an 
      administrative leave, on campus education at schools and activities of public rest 
      and entertainment areas were temporarily suspended. The measures have been 
      implemented for penitentiary institutions, dormitories, nursing homes, public 
      transport and intercity buses, and also weekend curfews are implemented. In 
      accordance with the pandemic plan, actions have been carried out with a 
      multi-sectoral approach, and preventive measures have been implemented to cover the 
      society as a whole.

TI  - Clinical laboratory and dispersion pattern of COVID-19 in a family cluster in the 
      social-distancing period.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the first reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 
      December 2019, the disease has spread worldwide. Different social isolation 
      strategies have been adopted to reduce community transmission, but few studies have 
      evaluated the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      2) infection in a family cluster during periods of isolation. We report an outbreak 
      in 24 members of a family cluster during a period of social distancing. METHODOLOGY: 
      We carried out an observational descriptive study of a family cluster infected with 
      SARS-CoV-2 in Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. Laboratory confirmation included RT-PCR 
      of nasopharyngeal samples or IgM or IgG serology. RESULTS: The attack rates were 75% 
      (19/24) based on laboratory-confirmed cases and 87.5% (21/24) including probable 
      cases. The time of spread was 17 days from the first case. All patients had mild 
      symptoms, requiring no hospitalization, and none of them died. The frequency of 
      symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed patients was higher among adults (94%) than among 
      children (50%); the paediatric age group also had a higher frequency of exposed 
      individuals who remained negative for infection. Ground-glass opacities on chest 
      computed tomography were present in all patients with reported dyspnoea. CONCLUSION: 
      This study highlights a high risk of intrahousehold transmission from an index case, 
      suggesting the need for (I) specific guidelines during periods of social distancing, 
      (II) minimization of external exposures and, above all, (III) adoption of strict 
      quarantine measures for suspected cases and family members to prevent outbreaks from 
      spreading.

AB  - In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, we set up a team to carry out sampling in 
      the community. This enabled individuals to remain in self-isolation in their own 
      homes and to prevent healthcare settings and services from being overwhelmed by 
      admissions for sampling of suspected cases. There is evidence that this is a cost 
      effective, safe and necessary service to complement COVID-19 testing in hospitals.

AB  - Hubei province in China has completed cycle of quarantine-resumption in 23rd 
      Janauary and 8th April 2020, providing a unique opportunity as for now to assess its 
      intervention impact and the pattern of SARS-COV-2 transmission during the quarantine 
      period. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the metropolitan-wide quarantine on 
      the trend and transmission route of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China. The 
      intervention reduces more than 70% of new infections in both households and the 
      public space, as well as the deaths caused by COVID-19 pneumonia. Household 
      transmission is the dominant route of disease spread regardless of quarantine. This 
      will provide important evidence and scientific insights to other worldwide countries 
      that are currently under quarantine.

AB  - The year 2020 started with a report about a cluster of pneumonia cases from Wuhan, 
      China, that were later identified to be caused by the novel coronavirus. By March 
      11, this outbreak was designated as a pandemic by World Health Organization. So far, 
      it has affected 213 countries and territories around the world. It is an infectious 
      disease (R0: 2.2 to 3.3) with confirmed human-to-human transmission. The high 
      morbidity and mortality attributed to viral infection has overwhelmed the health 
      systems of most countries across the globe. As of now, there is no confirmed 
      treatment or vaccine against COVID-19. The current pharmacological management relies 
      only on supportive care. Therefore, only non-pharmacological approaches are left to 
      protect people from infection. Established preventive methods against infection 
      include dodging the exposure from the virus, which will break the chain of 
      transmission and prevent further human-to-human spread. In the present paper, we 
      discuss the various non-pharmacological approaches that have to be adopted at the 
      personal or community level and by the healthcare providers to win against this 
      virus.

TI  - Evaluation of the potential incidence of COVID-19 and effectiveness of containment 
      measures in Spain: a data-driven approach.
PG  - 157

LID - 157
AB  - BACKGROUND: We are currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and 
      containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While 
      China-where the outbreak started-seems to have been able to contain the growth of 
      the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays present in multiple countries. 
      Nonetheless, authorities have taken action and implemented containment measures, 
      even if not everything is known. METHODS: To facilitate this task, we have studied 
      the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work 
      referred initially to the situation in Spain as of February 28, 2020, where a few 
      dozens of cases had been detected, but has been updated to match the current 
      situation as of 13 April. We implemented an SEIR metapopulation model that allows 
      tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic 
      simulations. RESULTS: Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations 
      from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early 
      detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and 
      public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which, 
      although might not be sufficient for disease eradication, would produce as a second 
      order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Many quantitative aspects of the natural history of the disease are 
      still unknown, such as the amount of possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of 
      age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. However, preparedness 
      plans and mitigation interventions should be ready for quick and efficacious 
      deployment globally. The scenarios evaluated here through data-driven simulations 
      indicate that measures aimed at reducing individuals' flow are much less effective 
      than others intended for early case identification and isolation. Therefore, 
      resources should be directed towards detecting as many and as fast as possible the 
      new cases and isolate them.

TI  - A Mobile Health Platform to Disseminate Validated Institutional Measurements During 
      the COVID-19 Outbreak: Utilization-Focused Evaluation Study.
PG  - e18668
LID - 10.2196/18668 [doi]
LID - e18668
AB  - BACKGROUND: As part of the response plans for the current outbreak of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), authorities are drafting and 
      implementing containment measures across jurisdictions worldwide in the effort to 
      slow down transmission and reduce the infection rate. A solid communication strategy 
      is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals, reduce 
      misinformation, and efficiently implement recommended measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim 
      of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mobile health (mHealth) 
      platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about SARS-CoV-2 to all 
      medical staff of the Children's Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva. 
      METHODS: Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, 
      local containment procedures, and frequently asked questions and answers for parents 
      were made available to the staff through a mobile app developed in the University of 
      Geneva, Switzerland. Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored 
      user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnosis of the 
      first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020. RESULTS: From February 
      25, 2020, to March 13, 2020 (18 days), information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were 
      viewed 859 times, which accounted for 35.6% of the total content views (total 
      views=332). User activity increased significantly with 50.8 (SD 14.4) users per day 
      in this period as compared to the previous weeks (mean 26.4, SD 9.8; P&lt;.001). In 
      addition, session numbers per day more than doubled during the aforementioned period 
      (P&lt;.001). In a survey, medical staff found the information easy to find within the 
      app. On a 10-point Likert scale, the ability of the app to reassure staff in 
      clinical practice was rated as 7.6 (SD 2.1), time-saving ability was rated as 8.5 
      (SD 2.1), and the need to look for information from other sources was rated as 5.9 
      (SD 3.3). CONCLUSIONS: The use of an mHealth solution to disseminate novel 
      coronavirus-related information seemed to be an effective and time-saving 
      communication channel within our institution during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Medical 
      staff felt reassured and informed in daily practice. More research should be done on 
      the clinical impact and outcomes of the integration of mHealth solutions as a 
      communication channel of validated information within health institutions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of respiratory coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19), is a current, ongoing life-threatening crisis, and international 
      public health emergency. The early diagnosis and management of the disease remains a 
      major challenge. In this review, we aim to summarize the updated epidemiology, 
      causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of 
      the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A broad search of the 
      literature was performed in "PubMed" "Medline" "Web of Science", "Google Scholar" 
      and "World Health Organization-WHO" using the keywords "severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus", "2019-nCoV", "COVID-19, "SARS", "SARS-CoV-2" "Epidemiology" 
      "Transmission" "Pathogenesis" "Clinical Characteristics". We reviewed and documented 
      the information obtained from literature on epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical 
      appearances of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The global cases of COVID-19 as of 
      April 2, 2020, have risen to more than 900,000 and morbidity has reached more than 
      47,000. The incidence rate for COVID-19 has been predicted to be higher than the 
      previous outbreaks of other coronavirus family members, including those of SARS-CoV 
      and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The main clinical 
      presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic stages to severe lower 
      respiratory infection in the form of pneumonia. Most of the patients also presented 
      with fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia and breathlessness. 
      Individuals at higher risk for severe illness include elderly people and patients 
      with a weakened immune system or that are suffering from an underlying chronic 
      medical condition like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer, respiratory illness 
      or cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-Cov-2 has emerged as a worldwide 
      threat, currently affecting 170 countries and territories across the globe. There is 
      still much to be understood regarding SARS-CoV-2 about its virology, epidemiology 
      and clinical management strategies; this knowledge will be essential to both manage 
      the current pandemic and to conceive comprehensive measures to prevent such 
      outbreaks in the future.

AB  - Seven years after the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak, a new severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) made its first appearance in a 
      food market in Wuhan, China, drawing an entirely new course to our lives. As the 
      virus belongs to the same genus of MERS and SARS, researchers have been trying to 
      draw lessons from previous outbreaks to find a potential cure. Although there were 
      five Phase I human vaccine trials against SARS and MERS, the lack of data in humans 
      provided us with limited benchmarks that could help us design a new vaccine for 
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we showcase the similarities in 
      structures of virus components between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in areas 
      relevant to vaccine design. Using the ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health 
      Organization (WHO) databases, we shed light on the 16 current approved clinical 
      trials worldwide in search for a COVID-19 vaccine. The different vaccine platforms 
      being tested are Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines, DNA and RNA-based 
      vaccines, inactivated vaccines, protein subunits, and viral vectors. By thoroughly 
      analyzing different trials and platforms, we also discuss the advantages and 
      disadvantages of using each type of vaccine and how they can contribute to the 
      design of an adequate vaccine for COVID-19. Studying past efforts invested in 
      conducting vaccine trials for MERS and SARS will provide vital insights regarding 
      the best approach to designing an effective vaccine against COVID-19.

TI  - Supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental disability during the 
      first 100 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the USA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unknown how the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the 
      current acute respiratory illness COVID-19 pandemic that has infected millions of 
      people, affects people with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). The aim 
      of this study is to describe how individuals with IDD have been affected in the 
      first 100 days of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Shortly after the first COVID-19 
      case was reported in the USA, our organisation, which provides continuous support 
      for over 11 000 individuals with IDD, assembled an outbreak committee composed of 
      senior leaders from across the health care organisation. The committee led the 
      development and deployment of a comprehensive COVID-19 prevention and suppression 
      strategy, utilising current evidence-based practice, while surveilling the global 
      and local situation daily. We implemented enhanced infection control procedures 
      across 2400 homes, which were communicated to our employees using multi-faceted 
      channels including an electronic resource library, mobile and web applications, 
      paper postings in locations, live webinars and direct mail. Using custom-built 
      software applications enabling us to track patient, client and employee cases and 
      exposures, we leveraged current public health recommendations to identify cases and 
      to suppress transmission, which included the use of personal protective equipment. A 
      COVID-19 case was defined as a positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 
      RESULTS: In the 100-day period between 20 January 2020 and 30 April 2020, we 
      provided continuous support for 11 540 individuals with IDD. Sixty-four per cent of 
      the individuals were in residential, community settings, and 36% were in 
      intermediate care facilities. The average age of the cohort was 46 ± 12 years, and 
      60% were male. One hundred twenty-two individuals with IDD were placed in quarantine 
      for exhibiting symptoms and signs of acute infection such as fever or cough. 
      Sixty-six individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and their average age was 50. 
      The positive individuals were located in 30 different homes (1.3% of total) across 
      14 states. Fifteen homes have had single cases, and 15 have had more than one case. 
      Fifteen COVID-19-positive individuals were hospitalised. As of 30 April, seven of 
      the individuals hospitalised have been discharged back to home and are recovering. 
      Five remain hospitalised, with three improving and two remaining in intensive care 
      and on mechanical ventilation. There have been three deaths. We found that among 
      COVID-19-positive individuals with IDD, a higher number of chronic medical 
      conditions and male sex were characteristics associated with a greater likelihood of 
      hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: In the first 100 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the 
      USA, we observed that people with IDD living in congregate care settings can benefit 
      from a coordinated approach to infection control, case identification and cohorting, 
      as evidenced by the low relative case rate reported. Male individuals with higher 
      numbers of chronic medical conditions were more likely to be hospitalised, while 
      most younger, less chronically ill individuals recovered spontaneously at home.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are 
      essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as 
      highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak 
      of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health 
      security capacities against public health risks and events. METHODS: We used 18 
      indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data 
      from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) 
      respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 
      data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the 
      indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 
      5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six 
      geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent 
      capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 
      81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at 
      levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) 
      countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) 
      countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and 
      events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at 
      level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in 
      place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 
      2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control 
      an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 
      5). INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, 
      detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong 
      operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response 
      to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings 
      from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness 
      capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between 
      countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control. FUNDING: 
      None.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To report about the successful outbreak containment of COVID-19 in 
      Shantou, one of the prefectural cities of Guangdong province in the mainland China. 
      METHODOLOGY: All patients confirmed as having COVID-19 between 23 January and 25 
      March 2020 by RT-PCR assay in the clinical lab of Shantou CDC were included and 
      divided into three groups based on the source of identification: hospital diagnosis, 
      contact tracing, and community screening. Collected data was analyzed and compared 
      among these three groups. RESULTS: A total of 25 COVID-19 cases were identified in 
      Shantou. The first case was identified on 14 January 2020 at one of two COVID-19 
      dedicated hospitals in Shantou. The majority of the cases were either imported from 
      Wuhan or linked to Wuhan/Hubei. The median lag time for diagnosis (i.e., the time 
      between symptom onset and case confirmation) was 2 days (IQR, 2.0-4.0) for all 
      cases, 9 days (IQR, 7.0-10.0) for the cases diagnosed in hospitals, 2 days (IQR, 
      1.5-2.0) for the cases in contact tracing, and 4 days (IQR, 2.5-4.5) for cases in 
      community screening, with a significantly longer diagnosis lag time in hospitals (p 
      = 0.003). Multivariate linear regression models showed larger family size and severe 
      cases as the significant predictor for increasing number of close contacts. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The current pandemic appears to exist for an uncertain period. The 
      early containment measures applied in Shantou, a city with insufficient healthcare 
      resources for COVID-19, seems to be appropriate for cities or areas with similar 
      profiles.

AB  - The present study provides an overview of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      outbreak which has rapidly extended globally within a short period. COVID-19 is a 
      highly infectious respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus known as 
      SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2). SARS-CoV-2 is 
      different from usual coronaviruses responsible for mild sickness such as common cold 
      among human beings. It is crucial to understand the impact and outcome of this 
      pandemic. We therefore overview the changes in the curves of COVID-19 confirmed 
      cases and fatality rate in China and outside of China from 31(st) of December 2019 
      to 25(th) of March 2020. We also aimed to assess the temporal developments and death 
      rate of COVID-19 in China and worldwide. More than 414,179 confirmed cases of 
      COVID-19 have been reported in 197 countries, including 81,848 cases in China and 
      332,331 outside of China. Furthermore, 18,440 infected patients died from COVID-19 
      infection; 3,287 cases were from China and 15,153 fatalities were reported 
      worldwide. Among the worldwide infected cases, 113,802 patients have been recovered 
      and discharged from different hospitals. Effective prevention and control measures 
      should be taken to control the disease. The presented Chinese model (protocol) of 
      disease prevention and control could be utilized in order to curb the pandemic 
      situation.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which initially began in China, has 
      spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of confirmed cases 
      increasing every day. With a death toll exceeding that of the SARS-CoV outbreak back 
      in 2002 and 2003 in China, 2019-nCoV has led to a public health emergency of 
      international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. Herein, we 
      present on an overview of the currently available information on the pathogenesis, 
      epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In late December 2019 and on 1st January 2020, the coronavirus 
      (COVID-19) infecting humans was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 
      Later cases have also been confirmed worldwide. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that 
      are phenotypically and genotypically diverse. Globally, as of 6th April 2020, 
      laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported to the World Health Organisation 
      (WHO) amounted to 1 211 214, including 67 666 deaths. AIM: In the current study, we 
      performed a literature review on coronavirus outbreak to summarise details about the 
      pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis and the management strategies for the disease 
      control. PATHOGENESIS: Coronaviruses are tremendously precise and mature only in 
      differentiated respiratory epithelial cells, as seen in both organ cultures as well 
      as human volunteers. This virus will cause the antiviral T-cell response to be 
      erratic, owing to the T-cell apoptosis activation, triggering the immune system to 
      collapse. TRANSMISSION: The understanding of the transmission of COVID-19 risk is 
      incomplete. The transmission mainly occurs through the respiratory droplets once an 
      infected person sneezes, like the spread of flu and other respiratory infectious 
      agents. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Presentations of COVID-19 includes fever, cough, 
      shortness of breath, malaise and respiratory distress. TREATMENT: There have been no 
      approved vaccines available for COVID-19 until today. The Ministry of Science and 
      Technology in the People's Republic of China declared three potential antiviral 
      medicines suitable for treating COVID-19. Those three medicines are, namely, 
      favilavir, chloroquine phosphate and remdesivir. Hydroxychloroquine combined with 
      azithromycin enhances the reduction of the viral load in COVID-19 patients. 
      CONCLUSION: The corona virus transmits quicker than its two predecessors the 
      MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has reduced casualty. The global effects of this latest 
      pandemic are still unclear. Nevertheless, considering that so far no vaccine has 
      been available; preventive approaches are the best way to fight against the virus.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by novel enveloped single stranded RNA 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for an ongoing global pandemic. While other 
      countries deployed widespread testing as an early mitigation strategy, the U.S. 
      experienced delays in development and deployment of organism identification assays. 
      As such, there is uncertainty surrounding disease burden and community spread, 
      severely hampering containment efforts. COVID-19 illuminates the need for a tiered 
      diagnostic approach to rapidly identify clinically significant infections and reduce 
      disease spread. Without the ability to efficiently screen patients, hospitals are 
      overwhelmed, potentially delaying treatment for other emergencies. A multi-tiered, 
      diagnostic strategy incorporating a rapid host immune response assay as a screening 
      test, molecular confirmatory testing and rapid IgM/IgG testing to assess benefit 
      from quarantine/further testing and provide information on population exposure/herd 
      immunity would efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 patients. Triaging patients 
      within minutes with a fingerstick rather than hours/days after an invasive swab is 
      critical to pandemic response as reliance on the existing strategy is limited by 
      assay accuracy, time to results, and testing capacity. Early screening and triage is 
      achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response 
      testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.Key 
      messagesDelayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall 
      disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment 
      and healthcare system preparation efforts.A multi-tiered testing strategy 
      incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future 
      pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby 
      facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks 
      and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, 
      validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities.The ability to triage patients 
      at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, 
      for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 
      and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic 
      response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat 
      the current outbreak.

AB  - A cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in Wuhan, China, at the 
      end of December 2019. The cluster was largely associated with a seafood and animal 
      market. A novel Betacoronavirus was quickly identified as the causative agent, and 
      it is shown to be related genetically to SARS-CoV and other bat-borne SARS-related 
      Betacoronaviruses. The number of cases increased rapidly and spread to other 
      provinces in China, as well as to another four countries. To help control the spread 
      of the virus, a "cordon sanitaire" was instituted for Wuhan on January 23, 2020, and 
      subsequently extended to other cities in Hubei Province, and the outbreak declared a 
      Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the Director General of the 
      World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the 
      International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes was 
      named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. This article described the 
      evolution of the outbreak, and the known properties of the novel virus, SARS-CoV-2 
      and the clinical disease it causes, and the major public health measures being used 
      to help control it's spread. These measures include social distancing, intensive 
      surveillance and quarantining of cases, contact tracing and isolation, cancellation 
      of mass gatherings, and community containment. The virus is the third zoonotic 
      coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but appears to be the only one with 
      pandemic potential. However, a number of important properties of the virus are still 
      not well understood, and there is an urgent need to learn more about its 
      transmission dynamics, its spectrum of clinical severity, its wildlife origin, and 
      its genetic stability. In addition, more research is needed on possible 
      interventions, particularly therapeutic and vaccines.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a pandemic 
      spreading in most countries including Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current 
      knowledge of COVID-19 and the virus causing it, SARS-CoV-2, was reviewed. The 
      epidemiology and control in different countries was compared and the differences 
      discussed. RESULTS: The population attack rates and case fatality rates vary from 
      country to country with Lombardy in northern Italy reporting an attack rate in the 
      general population of 0.37% compared to 0.004% in Hong Kong. The differences are 
      caused by different testing strategies and reporting systems. CONCLUSION: Turkey is 
      early in the outbreak. Different control strategies are available with South Korea, 
      Hong Kong and Singapore being models to follow.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-nCoV-2), was first 
      reported in Wuhan, China, in December, 2019. Since the outbreak, the virus has 
      infected more than 9,866,685 individuals, 4,983,029 treated and discharged and 
      495,692 deaths globally. The first Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nigeria 
      was imported in February, 2020 and since then community transmission has been 
      prevalent. As at the time of writing this report, Nigeria has reported about 23,298 
      cases of COVID-19, 8,253 treated and discharged and 554 deaths, giving a case 
      mortality ratio of 2.4%. While responsible government agencies and international 
      partners have been working hard to curtail the spread of the disease, we present in 
      this report, some matters arising from managing COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria; and 
      proffered suggestions which could help not only in managing the current COVID-19 
      pandemic, but also for winning future outbreaks of public health significance with a 
      view to curtailing global health security.

      vaccines are available to treat or prevent COVID-19, therefore nonpharmacological 
      public health measures are more in focus. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to assess the 
      effects of quarantine - alone or in combination with other measures - during 
      coronavirus outbreaks. METHODS: Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, WHO 
      commissioned a rapid review. To save time, the method of systematic reviews was 
      slightly and with caution modified. This publication is a summary of the most 
      important aspects of the rapid review, translated into German by members of the WHO 
      Collaborating Centre at the Danube University Krems (Austria). RESULTS: Overall, 29 
      studies were included. Ten modeling studies focused on COVID-19, 4 observational 
      studies and 15 modeling studies focused on SARS and MERS. The modeling studies 
      consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures. For example, 
      the models estimated that quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected 
      cases of COVID-19 prevented between 44 and 81% of the cases that would otherwise 
      have happened and 31 to 63% of the deaths, when compared to no such measures. In 
      regard to costs, the earlier the quarantine measures are implemented, the greater 
      the cost savings will be. CONCLUSION: Our confidence in the evidence is very 
      limited. This is mainly because the COVID-19 studies based their models on the 
      limited data that have been available in the early weeks of the pandemic and made 
      different assumptions about the virus. The studies of SARS and MERS are not 
      completely generalizable to COVID-19. Despite only having limited evidence, all the 
      studies found quarantine to be important for controlling the spread of severe 
      coronavirus diseases. Looking to the coming months, in order to maintain the best 
      possible balance of measures, decision makers must continue to constantly monitor 
      the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures they implement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Review of the evidence on the psychosocial impact of quarantine measures 
      during serious coronavirus outbreaks before COVID-19. Such information is highly 
      relevant in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Search of the MEDLINE database 
      for relevant studies related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks. RESULTS: Across 13 
      identified studies, quarantine measures were consistently associated with negative 
      psychosocial outcomes, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, stress, 
      posttraumatic stress, social isolation, loneliness and stigmatization. Determinants 
      comprised duration of quarantine measures and income losses. Health care workers 
      constituted a particularly vulnerable group. CONCLUSION: Quarantine measures during 
      serious coronavirus outbreaks have extensive negative consequences for mental 
      health. Prevention and intervention approaches to attenuate the psychosocial impact 
      should be an integral component of crisis response during pandemic conditions.

TI  - Searching for SARS-COV-2 on Particulate Matter: A Possible Early Indicator of 
      COVID-19 Epidemic Recurrence.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17092986 [doi]
LID - 2986
AB  - A number of nations were forced to declare a total shutdown due to COVID-19 
      infection, as extreme measure to cope with dramatic impact of the pandemic, with 
      remarkable consequences both in terms of negative health outcomes and economic 
      loses. However, in many countries a "Phase-2" is approaching and many activities 
      will re-open soon, although with some differences depending on the severity of the 
      outbreak experienced and SARS-COV-2 estimated diffusion in the general population. 
      At the present, possible relapses of the epidemic cannot be excluded until effective 
      vaccines or immunoprophylaxis with human recombinant antibodies will be properly set 
      up and commercialized. COVD-19-related quarantines have triggered serious social 
      challenges, so that decision makers are concerned about the risk of wasting all the 
      sacrifices imposed to the people in these months of quarantine. The availability of 
      possible early predictive indicators of future epidemic relapses would be very 
      useful for public health purposes, and could potentially prevent the suspension of 
      entire national economic systems. On 16 March, a Position Paper launched by the 
      Italian Society of Environmental Medicine (SIMA) hypothesized for the first time a 
      possible link between the dramatic impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy and 
      the high concentrations of particulate matter (PM(10) and PM(2.5)) that characterize 
      this area, along with its well-known specific climatic conditions. Thereafter, a 
      survey carried out in the U.S. by the Harvard School of Public Health suggested a 
      strong association between increases in particulate matter concentration and 
      mortality rates due to COVID-19. The presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on the particulate 
      matter of Bergamo, which is not far from Milan and represents the epicenter of the 
      Italian epidemic, seems to confirm (at least in case of atmospheric stability and 
      high PM concentrations, as it usually occurs in Northern Italy) that the virus can 
      create clusters with the particles and be carried and detected on PM(10). Although 
      no assumptions can be made concerning the link between this first experimental 
      finding and COVID-19 outbreak progression or severity, the presence of SARS-COV-2 
      RNA on PM(10) of outdoor air samples in any city of the world could represent a 
      potential early indicator of COVID-19 diffusion. Searching for the viral genome on 
      particulate matter could therefore be explored among the possible strategies for 
      adopting all the necessary preventive measures before future epidemics start.

AB  - Sharing a common land border with China, Vietnam has faced a high risk of 
      transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Rapid decision making and 
      robust public health measures were established by the Vietnamese Government to 
      control the situation. As of 17 May 2020, Vietnam reported 320 total confirmed cases 
      of COVID-19, of whom 260 had fully recovered, while the remaining 60 cases were 
      still under treatment. Noteworthy, the current data still confirms zero deaths and 
      within the last 32 consecutive days prior to this submission, there have been no new 
      infections in the country. Valuable lessons from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
      in 2003 such as use of quarantine, early recognition and quick response to the 
      infection, and increased awareness of its citizens have put Vietnam in a somewhat 
      better position against COVID-19 compared to other places. Vietnam, at the current 
      time, mulls declaring an end of the current COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, which is caused by the 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still severe. In 
      order to optimize the epidemic response strategy, it is urgent to evaluate the 
      implemented prevention and control interventions (PCIs). Based on the reported data 
      of Chongqing and Guizhou Provinces, the phased dynamic models of COVID-19 were 
      constructed, the average intensity of the existing PCIs (from January 25 to March 2) 
      was estimated in these two provinces. The results indicate that both provinces have 
      carried out better control of the infected, but there are still differences in the 
      intensity of control for people who need close observation. Especially in Chongqing, 
      the estimated strength is significantly smaller than that in Guizhou. Furthermore, 
      qualitative evaluations on the epidemic of COVID-19 under different PCIs scenarios 
      suggest that containment strategy is still necessary to ensure the safety of 
      resumption of work and school, and quarantining the city of Wuhan is an important 
      and effective containment strategy to reduce the epidemic in other provinces.

AB  - Patan Academy of Health Sciences started preparedness for COVID-19 in response to 
      increasing number of patient in neighboring country. Outbreak preparedness in 
      resource limited setup is challenging. Despite this, preparedness was done in 
      reference to WHO interim guidance utilizing best available resources. During this 
      preparedness, one patient was isolated as suspected COVID-19. This paper presents 
      level of preparedness achieved with the limited resources and the lesson learned 
      while isolating the patient. Keywords: COVID-19; Disaster; hospital preparedness.

      region.
PG  - 798

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), the 
      causative agent of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), is a highly transmittable 
      virus. Since the first person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in 
      Italy on February 21(st), 2020, the number of people infected with SARS-COV-2 
      increased rapidly, mainly in northern Italian regions, including Piedmont. A strict 
      lockdown was imposed on March 21(st) until May 4(th) when a gradual relaxation of 
      the restrictions started. In this context, computational models and computer 
      simulations are one of the available research tools that epidemiologists can exploit 
      to understand the spread of the diseases and to evaluate social measures to 
      counteract, mitigate or delay the spread of the epidemic. METHODS: This study 
      presents an extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed-Susceptible 
      (SEIRS) model accounting for population age structure. The infectious population is 
      divided into three sub-groups: (i) undetected infected individuals, (ii) quarantined 
      infected individuals and (iii) hospitalized infected individuals. Moreover, the 
      strength of the government restriction measures and the related population response 
      to these are explicitly represented in the model. RESULTS: The proposed model allows 
      us to investigate different scenarios of the COVID-19 spread in Piedmont and the 
      implementation of different infection-control measures and testing approaches. The 
      results show that the implemented control measures have proven effective in 
      containing the epidemic, mitigating the potential dangerous impact of a large 
      proportion of undetected cases. We also forecast the optimal combination of 
      individual-level measures and community surveillance to contain the new wave of 
      COVID-19 spread after the re-opening work and social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      model is an effective tool useful to investigate different scenarios and to inform 
      policy makers about the potential impact of different control strategies. This will 
      be crucial in the upcoming months, when very critical decisions about easing control 
      measures will need to be taken.

AB  - The original coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China has become 
      a global pandemic. By tracking the earliest 118 COVID-19 cases in Canada, we 
      produced a Voronoi treemap to show the travel origins of the country's earliest 
      COVID-19 cases. By March 11, 2020, even though the majority (64.1%) of the world's 
      COVID-19 confirmed cases still had their origin in China, only 7.6% of Canada's 
      first 118 COVID-19 cases were related to travelers from China. The most commonly 
      reported travel history among the 118 cases related to the Middle East, the United 
      States, and Europe. Thus, in retrospect, broadening of early screening tools and 
      travel restrictions to countries and regions outside China may have helped control 
      global COVID-19 spread.

AB  - Hong Kong has been recently attacked by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In 
      late January 2020, it's shown a steadily increasing trend of confirmed cases. There 
      is a 257 in total infected cases confirmed including 4 deaths until 20th of March 
      2020. To prevent further outbreak of COVID-19, this article discusses the current 
      understanding of COVID-19 and compares with the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2003 of 
      Hong Kong from the causes, transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and 
      preventions to study for an applicable measurement to control COVID-19.

      provincial region in South Korea. We estimated that nonpharmaceutical measures 
      reduced transmissibility by a maximum of 34% without resorting to a strict lockdown 
      strategy. To optimize epidemic control, continuous efforts to monitor the 
      transmissibility are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) firstly announced in Wuhan of 
      Hubei province, China is rapidly spreading to all the other 31 provinces of China 
      and to more than 140 countries. Quarantine strategies play the key role on the 
      disease controlling and public health in the world with this pandemic of the 
      COVID-19 defined by the World Health Organization. METHODS: In this study, a SEIRQ 
      epidemic model was developed to explore the dynamic changes of COVID-19 in Wuhan and 
      mainland China, from January 27, 2020 to March 5, 2020. Moreover, to investigate the 
      effects of the quarantine strategies, two perspectives are employed from the 
      different quarantine magnitudes and quarantine time points. RESULTS: The major 
      results suggest that the COVID-19 variations are well captured by the epidemic model 
      with very high accuracy in the cumulative confirmed cases, confirmed cases, 
      cumulative recovered cases and cumulative death cases. The quarantine magnitudes in 
      the susceptible individuals play larger roles on the disease control than the 
      impacts of the quarantines of the exposed individuals and infectious individuals. 
      For the quarantine time points, it shows that the early quarantine strategy is 
      significantly important for the disease controlling. The time delayed quarantining 
      will seriously increase the COVID-19 disease patients and prolongs the days of the 
      disease extinction. CONCLUSIONS: Our model can simulate and predict the COVID-19 
      variations and the quarantine strategies are important for the disease controlling, 
      especially at the early period of the disease outbreak. These conclusions provide 
      important scientific information for the government policymaker in the disease 
      control strategies.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a recent pandemic which has spread to 
      over 200 countries of the world since its outbreak. As of 21st April, 2020, more 
      than 2.3 million confirmed cases have been reported. The World Health Organization 
      (WHO) has issued a strategic preparedness response plan for countries at risk. This 
      is based on the knowledge of previous epidemics and experience shared by Chinese 
      health authorities. There is special emphasis on strict 'quarantine and isolation' 
      of suspected/diagnosed cases. Pakistan is a developing country with a weak 
      healthcare system. Pakistan Armed Forces have always provided services to the 
      countrymen during natural and man-made disasters. During this pandemic the largest 
      rehabilitation institute in the country was converted into a 130-bed dedicated 
      isolation and quarantine facility for the COVID-19 patients. We will share our 
      experience of establishing and managing this quarantine and isolation facility and 
      highlight the achievements and out-of-the-box solutions applicable for low resource 
      countries like Pakistan.

TI  - DISPERSION OF A NEW CORONAVIRUS SARS-COV-2 BY AIRLINES IN 2020: TEMPORAL ESTIMATES 
      OF THE OUTBREAK IN MEXICO.
PG  - 138-143
LID - 10.24875/RIC.20000113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: On January 23, 2020, China imposed a quarantine on the city of Wuhan to 
      contain the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Regardless of this measure, the new infection has 
      spread to several countries around the world. OBJECTIVE: We developed a method to 
      study the dissemination of this infection by airline routes and provide estimations 
      of the time of arrival of the outbreak to different cities. METHODS: Using the 
      Kermack and McKendrick model complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of 
      nodes and edges, we made an analysis of COVID-19 dispersion to other cities by air 
      travel. RESULTS: The estimation was accurate in that it was possible to predict in 
      the middle of February 2020 the arrival of the first outbreak in Mexico, which 
      eventually occurred between March 20 and 30. This estimation was robust with respect 
      to small changes in epidemiological parameters at the other nodes. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      estimation of the time of arrival of the outbreak from its epicenter, allows for a 
      time period to implement and strengthen preventive measures aimed at the general 
      population as well as to strengthen hospital infrastructure and training of human 
      resources. In the present study, this estimation was accurate, as observed from the 
      real data of the beginning of the outbreak in Mexico City up to April 6, 2020.

TI  - Modelling and assessing the effects of medical resources on transmission of novel

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), a newly emerging disease in China, posed 
      a public health emergency of China. Wuhan is the most serious affected city. Some 
      measures have been taken to control the transmission of COVID-19. From Jan. 23rd, 
      2020, gradually increasing medical resources (such as health workforce, protective 
      clothing, essential medicines) were sent to Wuhan from other provinces, and the 
      government has established the hospitals to quarantine and treat infected 
      individuals. Under the condition of sufficient medical resources in Wuhan, 
      late-stage of epidemic showed a downward trend. Assessing the effectiveness of 
      medical resources is of great significance for the future response to similar 
      disease. Based on the transmission mechanisms of COVID-19 and epidemic 
      characteristics of Wuhan, by using time-dependent rates for some parameters, we 
      establish a dynamical model to reflect the changes of medical resources on 
      transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Our model is applied to simulate the reported 
      data on cumulative and new confirmed cases in Wuhan from Jan. 23rd to Mar. 6th, 
      2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number R(0) = 2.71, which determines 
      whether the disease will eventually die out or not under the absence of effective 
      control measures. Moreover, we calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio 
      R(e)(t), which is used to measure the 'daily reproduction number'. We obtain that 
      R(e)(t) drops less than 1 since Feb. 8th. Our results show that delayed opening the 
      'Fire God Hill' hospital will greatly increase the magnitude of the outbreak. This 
      shows that the government's timely establishment of hospitals and effective 
      quarantine via quick detection prevent a larger outbreak.

AB  - It was on 31st December 2019, that a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported to the 
      World Health Organization (WHO) by China. The initial investigations revealed the 
      cases to be due to a previously unknown "never before seen strain of coronavirus". 
      Coronaviruses are a group of viruses, which are normally present among animals such 
      as cows, bats, camels and cats. The disease was officially named COVID-19 by WHO on 
      11th February 2020. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the 
      virus as SARS-CoV-2 due to its resemblance to SARS coronavirus. According to WHO's 
      Situation Report-28 as of 17th February 2020, globally there were 71,429 confirmed 
      cases, which included both laboratories confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases 
      (applicable only to Hubei province of China). Cases are clinically diagnosed based 
      on their signs and symptoms and chest x-rays without laboratory testing. More than 
      99% of these are in China i.e. 70,635 and 794 are outside China. The cases reported 
      outside of China belong to 25 countries in various regions of WHO: China having the 
      epicenter of the disease bears the greatest brunt, with 1772 deaths. The three 
      deaths outside China have been reported in Philippines, Japan and France. The case 
      fatality rate of COVID-19 ranges between 2-3% A wide spectrum of disease, ranging 
      from mild to severe, has been reported in confirmed cases of COVID-19. Respiratory 
      symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, fatigue, breathing difficulties and 
      bilateral lung infiltrates on C.T are common findings. Pakistan so far has not 
      reported any confirmed case of COVID-19. Government is showing its commitment 
      towards the threat of importation. This novel coronavirus, called as a "devil" by 
      Chinese Prime Minister, Xi Ping is really an enigma.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of the current pandemic begun from the first 
      individual of a 55-year old from Hubei province in China, the disease instigated by 
      the new coronavirus spreading across the world. Scientists presently speculate this 
      coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, originated in a bat and by one way or another jumped to 
      another creature, potentially the pangolin, which at that point gave it to people. 
      The ailment is currently spreading between individuals with no animal delegate. 
      Researchers are struggling to follow the infection back to where it started to 
      become familiar with its spread. In the event that, for example, specialists can 
      locate the soonest cases, they might have the option to distinguish the creature 
      have where the infection hides. In March and April 2020, researchers detailed that 
      this virus created normally. Coronavirus has been become of the serious global 
      phenomena in the recent years and has negative effects in the entire world health 
      and economy. The virus is believed to have been associated with a host animal which 
      human contracted. Subsequently, human-to-human infection began. Through migration as 
      humans have become complex with easy mobility the disease has traveled to the entire 
      continent. Now, numerous scientist are going on in the hope of obtaining medication 
      and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease and mortality of the disease. 
      It is important that we obtain quantitative and qualitative information about the 
      etiology of this disease which is crucial. Mathematical modeling is capable of 
      providing qualitative information on many parameters that guides the decision making 
      of health practitioners. In this work we focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with 
      the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). To find the role of 
      factors/parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find R(0); the ratio of 
      reproduction for the proposed model. METHODS: To find the role of parameters in the 
      transmission of the syndrome we find R(0); the ratio of reproduction for the 
      proposed model. On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non 
      Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence 
      formulate the optimal control mode. With the help of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian we 
      minimize the density of contaminated stuff and infected human population. RESULTS: 
      We focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical 
      Interventions(NPIs). On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply 
      Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence 
      formulate the optimal control model. The major NPIs are, STAY HOME, SANITIZER (wash 
      hands), EARLY CASE DETECTION (PCR Test) and FACE MASK. These NPIs helps in 
      mitigation and reducing the size of outbreak of the disease. CONCLUSION: We check 
      the existence of the optimal solution for the system. At the end, Using matlab we 
      produce numerical simulations for validation of results of control variables. The 
      results demonstrate that if there is no control (variables/interventios), 900 out 
      1000 susceptible individuals may be infected (exposed) in very short period. As such 
      a circumstances no agency fighting against COVID-19 could be successful due to its 
      limited resources.

AB  - Coronaviruses are large family-RNA viruses that belong to the order Nidovirales, 
      family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae. The novel COVID-19 infection, caused 
      by a beta coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, is a new outbreak that has been emerged in 
      Wuhan, China in December 2019. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, 
      cough, and dyspnea. As per the March 12, 2020, WHO report, more than 125,048 
      confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 4613 deaths have been identified in more than 117 
      countries. It is now regarded as a pandemic that seriously spread and attack the 
      world. The primary means of transmission is person to person through droplets that 
      occurred during coughing or sneezing, through personal contact (shaking hands), or 
      by touching contaminated objects. So far, there is no effective therapy and vaccine 
      available against this novel virus and therefore, only supportive care is used as 
      the mainstay of management of patients with COVID-19. The mortality rate of COVID-19 
      is considerable. This work aimed to provide insight on the newly emerged COVID-19, 
      in the hope to gain a better understanding on the general overview, epidemiology, 
      transmission, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes as well 
      as the prevention and control of COVID-19.

TI  - Initial Assessment of the Impact of the Emergency State Lockdown Measures on the 1st 
      Wave of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Portugal.
PG  - 733-741
LID - 10.20344/amp.14129 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Portugal took early action to control the COVID-19 epidemic, 
      initiating lockdown measures on March 16th when it recorded only 62 cases of 
      COVID-19 per million inhabitants and reported no deaths. The Portuguese public 
      complied quickly, reducing their overall mobility by 80%. The aim of this study was 
      to estimate the initial impact of the lockdown in Portugal in terms of the reduction 
      of the burden on the healthcare system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We forecasted epidemic 
      curves for: Cases, hospital inpatients (overall and in intensive care), and 
      deaths without lockdown, assuming that the impact of containment measures would 
      start 14 days after initial lockdown was implemented. We used exponential smoothing 
      models for deaths, intensive care and hospitalizations and an ARIMA model for number 
      of cases. Models were selected considering fitness to the observed data up to the 
      31st March 2020. We then compared observed (with intervention) and forecasted curves 
      (without intervention). RESULTS: Between April 1st and April 15th, there were 146 
      fewer deaths (-25%), 5568 fewer cases (-23%) and, as of April 15th, there were 519 
      fewer intensive care inpatients (-69%) than forecasted without the lockdown. On 
      April 15th, the number of intensive care inpatients could have reached 748, three 
      times higher than the observed value (229) if the intervention had been delayed. 
      DISCUSSION: If the lockdown had not been implemented in mid-March, Portugal 
      intensive care capacity (528 beds) would have likely been breached during the first 
      half of April. The lockdown seems to have been effective in reducing transmission of 
      SARS-CoV-2, serious COVID-19 disease, and associated mortality, thus decreasing 
      demand on health services. CONCLUSION: An early lockdown allowed time for the 
      National Health Service to mobilize resources and acquire personal 
      protective equipment, increase testing, contact tracing and hospital and intensive 
      care capacity and to promote broad prevention and control measures. When lifting 
      more stringent measures, strong surveillance and communication strategies that 
      mobilize individual prevention efforts are necessary.

AB  - The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time. 
      Health care systems globally are amid an unprecedented challenge. Since its 
      emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to 185 countries 
      worldwide, with more than 2.63 million cases confirmed and more than 183 thousand 
      related deaths (as of 23/04/2020). According to current evidence, the novel 
      coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human mainly via respiratory droplets of 
      different sizes, contact with bodily fluids, or from contaminated surfaces. In the 
      context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances 
      and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed. The common 
      clinical symptoms of the highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic virus include 
      fever, cough, fatigue, ageusia and anosmia and in some patients, gastrointestinal 
      infection symptoms. The elderly and patients with comorbidities are susceptible to 
      infection and prone to severe complications, which may be associated with acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokines storm. Currently, there are few 
      specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and 
      repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. Under these circumstances, it is 
      critical for health care settings, including nuclear medicine departments to take 
      infection control measures, to prevent a potential spread not just among patients 
      but also to staff members as well as to reconsider the performance of randomized 
      clinical trials. There have already been papers on the radiology preparedness that 
      should be applied to radiology and nuclear medicine departments to support the care 
      of patients with COVID-19 and maintain radiologic diagnostic and interventional 
      support for the entirety of the hospital and healthcare system, particularly for 
      emergencies, without jeopardizing an outbreak in the units. Since most nuclear 
      medicine diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are non-urgent, the general 
      guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for infection prevention 
      and control is to postpone scheduled procedure after cautious risk assessment, with 
      certain exceptions. Individualized approach of each case is a sine qua non of 
      ensuring low transmission of COVID-19 as well as effective and safe management of 
      patients admitted to nuclear medicine departments. Another major issue raised is the 
      possible impact COVID-19 on the transport of medical radioisotopes. By the 1(st) of 
      April 2020, the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) co-chaired the European Observatory on 
      Supply of Medical Radioisotope expressing their concerns related to the impact of 
      COVID-19 on the supply chain and inconsequence on the availability of the most vital 
      medical radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. Due to the current lockdown 
      situation, extended border controls, reductions and elimination of many commercial 
      passenger flights, competition and cost of cargo and charter options, required 
      appropriate additional support. The new era of nuclear medicine practice worldwide 
      coincides with a new era for the Hellenic Society of Nuclear Medicine (HSNM) and the 
      Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine (HJNM). The founder and Editor in Chief for 
      more than 28 consecutive years, Professor Emeritus Philip Grammaticos, resigned 
      leaving behind a benchmark for the presidencies and editors to come. His commitment 
      to the conservation of a high level of scientific excellence of the published papers 
      is the legacy which we wish to maintain in the future publications. The interim 
      Editor in Chief of the current issue, would like to express her gratitude to 
      Professor Emeritus Philip Grammaticos for his contribution to the global scientific 
      community as well as to the incoming Editor in Chief Konstantinos Anagnostopoulos, 
      MD, PhD, FRCP, FESC for accepting this new role. We wholeheartedly welcome the new 
      Editor in Chief and the new members of the Editorial Board, wishing them an active, 
      attentive and successful mandate. Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine will remain 
      true to the set principles, values and past and prepared to cope with future 
      challenges in the scientific and clinical setting.

TI  - How we should respond to the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: A German perspective.
PG  - 363-372
LID - 10.3233/CH-209004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic Germany missed to set up 
      efficient containment measures. Consequently, the number of cases increased 
      exponentially until a lockdown was implemented to suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 
      Fortunately, Germany has a high capability for coronavirus lab testing and more than 
      30,000 ICU beds. These capabilities and the lockdown turned out to be an advantage 
      to combat the pandemic and to prevent a health-system overload. AIM: The aim was to 
      predict the plateau day of SARS-CoV-2 infections or deaths. RESULTS: The effect on 
      the viral spread of the German measures taken and the impact on the peak of new 
      infection cases is shown. By normalizing daily case numbers, the plateau day of the 
      current outbreak in Germany could be calculated to be reached at April 12, 2020 (day 
      103 of 2020). CONCLUSION: Normalized case number curves are helpful to predict the 
      time point at which no further new infections will occur if the epidemic situation 
      remains stable. Upon reaching the plateau day during a lockdown phase, a residual 
      time-period of about 2-3 weeks can be utilized to prepare a safe unlocking period. 
      As can be learned from Asian countries such as South Korea and Taiwan there must be 
      strict rules to keep the risk of infection low. Those include social distancing, 
      face mask wearing in combination with digital contact tracing and serosurveillance 
      studies. Following those rules, a safe dance around the infection curve allows to 
      keep the population at a reduced infection rate.

TI  - The effectiveness of quarantine of Wuhan city against the Corona Virus Disease 2019 
      (COVID-19): A well-mixed SEIR model analysis.
PG  - 841-848
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25827 [doi]
AB  - A novel coronavirus pneumonia, first identified in Wuhan City and referred to as 
      COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, has been quickly spreading to other 
      cities and countries. To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a 
      quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020. To explore the effectiveness of 
      the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of 
      COVID-19 have been estimated. A well-mixed "susceptible exposed infectious 
      recovered" (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the 
      COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical 
      progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority. 
      Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency period, the 
      well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact rate of latent 
      individuals are within 6-18, which represented the possible impact of quarantine and 
      isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other parameter were suppose 
      as unchanged under the current intervention. The present study shows that, by 
      reducing the contact rate of latent individuals, interventions such as quarantine 
      and isolation can effectively reduce the potential peak number of COVID-19 
      infections and delay the time of peak infection.

AB  - The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, places 
      healthcare workers at an increased risk of infection as they are in close contact 
      with patients. In this article, we report an overview of cases of infected 
      healthcare workers in China and Italy during the early periods of the COVID-19 
      epidemic. China's coronavirus response highlights the importance of implementing 
      effective public health strategies. The authorities worldwide therefore, need to be 
      extremely cautious when they implement stringent protective measures that safeguard 
      healthcare workers in hospitals and counteract the threats created by the pandemic.

AB  - The sudden outbreak and uncontrolled spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) has shocked the world to a degree never seen before. Due to the wide 
      spread transmission of the virus, the number of infected cases worldwide has 
      surpassed 16,421,958 and global death toll has spiked up to 6,52,308 from December 
      2019 to 27 July 2020. The virus has been labelled as a pandemic by the WHO. 
      Virologists have found that this virus outbreak is similar to past outbreaks of 
      viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle 
      East Respiratory Syndrome that caused severe respiratory syndrome and transmitted 
      rapidly in humans. These single stranded RNA viruses come under the genera of 
      β-coronaviruses which ultimately infect lungs and respiratory tract. Even though the 
      origin, source and intermediate hosts of this virus is unknown, transmittance from 
      human-to-human through various paths has been identified globally. As of today, 
      there are no approved drugs and vaccines. Several clinical trials are being 
      conducted today to evaluate vaccines against the virus. The aim of our present 
      review is to furnish brief details about the statistics, diagnosis, epidemiology, 
      pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19 to assist researchers and the 
      society at large to come to grip with the deadly disease.HighlightsCumbersome 
      outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a pandemicAt June 
      19, 2020, as per WHO report 8,618,787 infected cases and 457,275 dead were recorded 
      globallyMajor spread was found to be human to human transmissionsPeople with 
      positive COVID-19 were infected with severe respiratory syndromeMore animal and 
      clinical studies have to be done to overcome this pandemic.

TI  - Political Intrusions into the International Health Regulations Treaty and Its Impact 
      on Management of Rapidly Emerging Zoonotic Pandemics: What History Tells Us.
PG  - 426-430
LID - 10.1017/S1049023X20000515 [doi]
AB  - For a large number of health care providers world-wide, the coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) pandemic is their first experience in population-based care. In past 
      decades, lower population densities, infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and 
      pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by natural disasters, predatory 
      animals, and war. In the early 1900s, Sir William Osler first advanced the knowledge 
      of zoonotic diseases that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals. Once 
      rare, they now make up 71% or more of new diseases. Globally, zoonotic spread occurs 
      for many reasons. Because the human population has grown in numbers and density, the 
      spread of these diseases accelerated though rapid unsustainable urbanization, 
      biodiversity loss, and climate change. Furthermore, they are exacerbated by an 
      increasing number of vulnerable populations suffering from chronic deficiencies in 
      food, water, and energy. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its International 
      Health Regulation (IHR) Treaty, organized to manage population-based diseases such 
      as Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV, and Ebola, have failed to meet population-based 
      expectations. In part, this is due to influence from powerful political donors, 
      which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global community 
      can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor 
      tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and 
      others have exercised over the WHO. In a highly integrated globalized world, both 
      the WHO with its IHR Treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective 
      mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide. Practitioners and 
      health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty, 
      a return of the WHO's singular global authority, and support highly coordinated 
      population-based management. As Osler recognized, his concept of "one medicine, one 
      health" defines what global public health is today.

TI  - Prudent public health intervention strategies to control the coronavirus disease 
      2019 transmission in India: A mathematical model-based approach.
PG  - 190-199
LID - 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_504_20 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised urgent 
      questions about containment and mitigation, particularly in countries where the 
      virus has not yet established human-to-human transmission. The objectives of this 
      study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks 
      of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus has already 
      established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact be mitigated 
      through quarantine of symptomatic patients? METHODS: These questions were addressed 
      in the context of India, using simple mathematical models of infectious disease 
      transmission. While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of 
      COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated 
      that appeared insensitive to model assumptions, as well as highlighting critical 
      data gaps. RESULTS: It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and 
      quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing 
      symptoms. In an optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R(0)) being 
      1.5, and asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would 
      reduce the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent. In the pessimistic scenario of 
      R(0)=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this 
      projected impact falls to two per cent. INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSIONS: 
      Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features 
      and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the 
      introduction of the virus into the community. Acting alone, however, such measures 
      would be insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer. Once the virus 
      establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a 
      meaningful impact on disease burden. Model projections are subject to substantial 
      uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural 
      history of infection of this novel virus. As a public health measure, health system 
      and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending spread of 
      COVID-19 in the country.

AB  - The outbreak of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported for the first time 
      in Wuhan, China in late December 2019 have rapidly spread to other countries and it 
      was declared on January 30, 2020 as a public health emergency of international 
      concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization. Before the first COVID-19 cases 
      were reported in Brazil, several measures have been implemented including the 
      adjustment of legal framework to carry out isolation and quarantine. As the cases 
      increased significantly, new measures, mainly to reduce mortality and severe cases, 
      have also been implemented. Rapid and robust preparedness actions have been 
      undertaken in Brazil while first cases have not yet been identified in 
      Latin-American. The outcome of this early preparation should be analyzed in future 
      studies.

AB  - The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      and its associated coronavirus disease has gripped the entire international 
      community and caused widespread public health concerns. Despite global efforts to 
      contain the disease spread, the outbreak is still on a rise because of the community 
      spread pattern of this infection. This is a zoonotic infection, similar to other 
      coronavirus infections, that is believed to have originated in bats and pangolins 
      and later transmitted to humans. Once in the human body, this coronavirus 
      (SARS-CoV-2) is abundantly present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of 
      affected patients, and its spread is predominantly thought to be respiratory 
      droplet/contact in nature. Dental professionals, including endodontists, may 
      encounter patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and will have to 
      act diligently not only to provide care but at the same time prevent nosocomial 
      spread of infection. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of 
      the epidemiology, symptoms, and routes of transmission of this novel infection. In 
      addition, specific recommendations for dental practice are suggested for patient 
      screening, infection control strategies, and patient management protocol.

TI  - Emergence of a Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): Protocol for Extending Surveillance 
      Used by the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre 
      and Public Health England.
PG  - e18606
LID - 10.2196/18606 [doi]
LID - e18606
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and 
      Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) have successfully worked 
      together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases for over 50 
      years, including three previous pandemics. With the emergence of the international 
      outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national approach to 
      containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19. 
      At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC's surveillance has been extended to 
      monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the 
      community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic 
      populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the 
      rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment 
      policy. METHODS: The RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, 
      extract pseudonymized data weekly. This extended surveillance comprises of five 
      components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has 
      been exposed to COVID-19. Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week 
      of request created new codes to support this. (2) Extension of current virological 
      surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory 
      tract infections (LRTI)-with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have 
      been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and 
      not seen in primary care. (3) Serology sample collection across all age groups. This 
      will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general 
      practice for a scheduled blood test. The 100 general practices currently undertaking 
      annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological 
      and serological surveillance. (4) Collecting convalescent serum samples. (5) Data 
      curation. We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if 
      needed. Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories. RESULTS: 
      General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of 
      clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance. Additionally, practices 
      participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 
      surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs. Within the first 2 weeks 
      of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding 
      system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system 
      into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy. The 
      extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported. 
      Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared 
      learning. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/18606.

TI  - Containment of a healthcare-associated COVID-19 outbreak in a university hospital in 
      Seoul, Korea: A single-center experience.
PG  - e0237692
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0237692 [doi]
LID - e0237692
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our hospital experienced the first healthcare-associated COVID-19 
      outbreak in Seoul at the time the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Korea. The 
      first confirmed COVID-19 patient was a hospital personnel who was in charge of 
      transferring patients inside our hospital. To contain the virus spread, we shutdown 
      our hospital, and tested all inpatients, medical staff members, and employees. 
      METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing 
      according to the contact history, occupation, and presence of respiratory symptoms. 
      Closed-circuit television (CCTV) was reviewed in the presence of an epidemiologist 
      to identify individuals who came into contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients. 
      RESULTS: A total of 3,091 respiratory samples from 2,924 individuals were obtained. 
      Among 2,924 individuals, two inpatients, and one caregiver tested positive 
      (positivity rate, 0.1%). Although all confirmed cases were linked to a general ward 
      designated for pulmonology patients, no medical staff members, medical support 
      personnel, or employees working at the same ward were infected. Contact with 
      confirmed COVID-19 cases was frequent among inpatients and medical support 
      personnel. The most common contact area was the general ward for pulmonology 
      patients and medical support areas, including clinical and imaging examination 
      rooms. Finally, the total number of hospital-associated infections was 14, 
      consisting of four diagnosed at our hospital and ten diagnosed outside the hospital. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The robust control of the COVID-19 outbreak further minimized the 
      transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital and local communities. However, there was 
      also a debate over the appropriate period of hospital shutdown and testing of all 
      hospital staff and patients. Future studies are required to refine and establish the 
      in-hospital quarantine and de-isolation guidelines based on the epidemiological and 
      clinical settings.

AB  - The COVID-19 caused by a novel strain of coronavirus has been spreading rapidly 
      since its occurrence in December 2019. It is highly communicable through 
      human-to-human transmission. China has been making unprecedented efforts in treating 
      the confirmed cases, identifying and isolating their close contacts and suspected 
      cases to control the source of infection and cut the route of transmission. China's 
      devotion in handling this epidemic has effectively and efficiently curbed 
      communication domestically and across the border. Representative measures adopted by 
      Wenzhou, the worst hit city out of Hubei Province, are examined to elucidate those 
      massive undertakings with the aim of enhancing international understanding and 
      building global rapport in fighting this evolving epidemic situation.

TI  - The Pandemic League of COVID-19: Korea Versus the United States, With Lessons for 
      the Entire World.
PG  - 228-232
LID - 10.3961/jpmph.20.166 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is inflicting a brutal blow on humankind, and no 
      corner of the world has been exempted from its wrath. This study analyzes the chief 
      control measures and the distinctive features of the responses implemented by Korea 
      and the United States to contain COVID-19 with the goal of extracting lessons that 
      can be applied globally. Even though both nations reported their index cases on the 
      same day, Korea succeeded in flattening the curve, with 10 752 cases as of April 28, 
      2020, whereas the outbreak skyrocketed in the United States, which had more than 1 
      million cases at the same time. The prudent and timely execution of control 
      strategies enabled Korea to tame the spread of the virus, whereas the United States 
      paid a major price for its delay, although it is too early to render a conclusive 
      verdict. Information pertaining to the number of people infected with the virus and 
      measures instituted by the government to control the spread of COVID-19 was 
      retrieved from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the 
      Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites and press releases. 
      Drawing lessons from both nations, it is evident that the resolution to the COVID-19 
      pandemic lies in the prudent usage of available resources, proactive strategic 
      planning, public participation, transparency in information sharing, abiding by the 
      regulations that are put into place, and how well the plan of action is implemented.

TI  - Preventing and Mitigating SARS-CoV-2 Transmission - Four Overnight Camps, Maine, 
      June-August 2020.
PG  - 1216-1220
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm6935e1 [doi]
AB  - The World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a 
      pandemic on March 11, 2020.* Shortly thereafter, closures of 124,000 U.S. public and 
      private schools affected at least 55.1 million students through the end of the 
      2019-20 school year.(†) During the summer of 2020, approximately 82% of 8,947 U.S. 
      overnight camps did not operate.(§) In Maine, only approximately 20% of 100 
      overnight camps opened.(¶) An overnight camp in Georgia recently reported 
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, transmission among campers and staff 
      members when nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were not strictly followed (1); 
      however, NPIs have been successfully used to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among 
      military basic trainees (2). During June-August 2020, four overnight camps in Maine 
      implemented several NPIs to prevent and mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 
      including prearrival quarantine, pre- and postarrival testing and symptom screening, 
      cohorting, use of face coverings, physical distancing, enhanced hygiene measures, 
      cleaning and disinfecting, and maximal outdoor programming. During the camp 
      sessions, testing and symptom screening enabled early and rapid identification and 
      isolation of attendees with COVID-19. Among the 1,022 attendees (staff members and 
      campers) from 41 states, one territory, and six international locations, 1,010 were 
      tested before arrival; 12 attendees who had completed a period of isolation after 
      receiving a diagnosis of COVID-19 2 months before arrival were not tested. Four 
      (0.4%) asymptomatic attendees received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results before 
      arrival; these persons delayed their arrival, completed 10 days of isolation at 
      home, remained asymptomatic, and did not receive any further testing before arrival 
      or for the duration of camp attendance. Approximately 1 week after camp arrival, all 
      1,006 attendees without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were tested, and three 
      asymptomatic cases were identified. Following isolation of these persons and 
      quarantine of their contacts, no secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred. 
      These findings can inform similar multilayered public health strategies to prevent 
      and mitigate the introduction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children, 
      adolescents, and adults in congregate settings, such as overnight camps, residential 
      schools, and colleges.

TI  - Novel 2019 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): an overview for emergency clinicians.
PG  - 1-24
AB  - The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its infection, COVID-19, has quickly become a 
      worldwide threat to health, travel, and commerce. It is essential for emergency 
      clinicians to learn as much as possible about this pandemic to manage the 
      unprecedented burdens on healthcare providers and hospital systems. This review 
      analyzes information from worldwide research and experience on the epidemiology, 
      prevention, and treatment of COVID-19, and offers links to the most reliable and 
      trustworthy resources to help equip healthcare professionals in managing this public 
      health challenge. As the pandemic sweeps the United States, lessons learned from 
      early centers of infection, notably New York and Northern Italy, can help localities 
      to prepare.

TI  - Corona Virus (COVID-19) "Infodemic" and Emerging Issues through a Data Lens: The 
      Case of China.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17072309 [doi]
LID - 2309
AB  - Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a humanitarian emergency, which started in Wuhan in China 
      in early December 2019, brought into the notice of the authorities in late December, 
      early January 2020, and, after investigation, was declared as an emergency in the 
      third week of January 2020. The WHO declared this as Public Health Emergency of 
      International Concern (PHEIC) on 31th of January 2020, and finally a pandemic on 
      11th March 2020. As of March 24th, 2020, the virus has caused a casualty of over 
      16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people confirmed as infected by it, 
      of which more than 10,000 cases are serious. Mainly based on Chinese newspapers, 
      social media and other digital platform data, this paper analyzes the timeline of 
      the key actions taken by the government and people over three months in five 
      different phases. It found that although there was an initial delay in responding, a 
      unique combination of strong governance, strict regulation, strong community 
      vigilance and citizen participation, and wise use of big data and digital 
      technologies, were some of the key factors in China's efforts to combat this virus. 
      Being inviable and non-measurable (unlike radioactive exposure), appropriate and 
      timely information is very important to form the basic foundation of mitigation and 
      curative measures. Infodemic, as it is termed by WHO, is a key word, where different 
      stakeholder's participation, along with stricter regulation, is required to reduce 
      the impact of fake news in this information age and social media. Although different 
      countries will need different approaches, focusing on its humanitarian nature and 
      addressing infodemic issues are the two critical factors for future global 
      mitigation efforts.

TI  - Early Transmission Dynamics of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Nigeria.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17093054 [doi]
LID - 3054
AB  - On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of a novel 
      coronavirus disease in China that was later named COVID-19. On 11 March 2020, the 
      outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The first instance of the virus in 
      Nigeria was documented on 27 February 2020. This study provides a preliminary 
      epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. We 
      estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on 
      the Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial 
      interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the 
      infector), and adjusted for disease importation. By 11 April 2020, 318 confirmed 
      cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria. At day 45, the 
      exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05-0.10) with a 
      doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28-15.18). Separately for imported cases 
      (travel-related) and local cases, the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, 
      respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the 
      outbreak using a three-weekly window while adjusting for imported cases. The 
      estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65-8.41) at day 22 (19 March 
      2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.83-7.88) at day 25 (22 March 
      2020). The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest 
      value on 11 April 2020, was 1.42 (95% CrI: 1.26-1.58). These 45-day estimates 
      suggested that cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria have been remarkably lower than expected 
      and the preparedness to detect needs to be shifted to stop local transmission.

PG  - I-IV
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1671-0274.2020.02.001 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has become a public health 
      emergency in China. Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great 
      efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of 
      gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and 
      incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients 
      with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to 
      rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for 
      patients with fever (&gt;37.3℃), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or 
      contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention 
      measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should 
      also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be 
      properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established 
      by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation 
      should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special 
      period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant 
      tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor 
      therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly 
      recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications 
      of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage ≥ 2/rectal cancer T stage ≥ 3/unresectable 
      colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with 
      obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to 
      relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous 
      endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For 
      colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can 
      achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also 
      creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial 
      embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with 
      bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with 
      acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment 
      measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to 
      the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a 
      designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all 
      anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent 
      respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower 
      digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is 
      necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused 
      by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and 
      related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We 
      believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will 
      eventually win this war against NCP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spreads rapidly and has attracted 
      worldwide attention. METHODS: To improve the forecast accuracy and investigate the 
      spread of SARS-CoV-2, we constructed four mathematical models to numerically 
      estimate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the efficacy of eradication strategies. 
      RESULTS: Using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, and including 
      measures such as city closures and extended leave policies implemented by the 
      Chinese government that effectively reduced the β value, we estimated that the β 
      value and basic transmission number, R(0), of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.476/6.66 in Wuhan, 
      0.359/5.03 in Korea, and 0.400/5.60 in Italy. Considering medicine and vaccines, an 
      advanced model demonstrated that the emergence of vaccines would greatly slow the 
      spread of the virus. Our model predicted that 100,000 people would become infected 
      assuming that the isolation rate α in Wuhan was 0.30. If quarantine measures were 
      taken from March 10, 2020, and the quarantine rate of α was also 0.3, then the final 
      number of infected people was predicted to be 11,426 in South Korea and 147,142 in 
      Italy. CONCLUSIONS: Our mathematical models indicate that SARS-CoV-2 eradication 
      depends on systematic planning, effective hospital isolation, and SARS-CoV-2 
      vaccination, and some measures including city closures and leave policies should be 
      implemented to ensure SARS-CoV-2 eradication.

AB  - The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that occurred in 
      China is rapidly spreading globally. China's bond and strict containment measures 
      have been proved (in practice) to significantly reduce the spread of the epidemic. 
      This was obtained through the use of emergency control measures in the epidemic 
      areas and the integration of resources from multiple systems, including business, 
      community, technology, education, and transportation, across the country. In order 
      to better understand how China has managed to reduce the public health and economic 
      impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic, this editorial systematically reviews the specific 
      measures for infection prevention and control of the disease. The best practices for 
      COVID-19 eradication in China provide evidence-based strategies that could be 
      replicated in other countries.

AB  - Covid-19 represents one of the largest challenges in the recent history of public 
      health. It is fundamental that we strengthen scientific cooperation under a common 
      goal: to protect the health of the population. In this article, we present ideas 
      that need urgent and collaborative efforts. We discuss the estimation of the 
      magnitude of the epidemic through a nationwide seroprevalence panel, as well as new 
      strategies to monitor the epidemic in real time. We also analyze the negative 
      externalities associated to the pandemic. Finally, we present a general framework to 
      develop ideas to come out of the lockdown, highlighting the importance of 
      implementing sustainable and equitable structural interventions. We call for 
      solidarity and cooperation, focusing our efforts and creativity in the resolution of 
      the problems that currently affect Mexico and the world.

TI  - The Role of YouTube and the Entertainment Industry in Saving Lives by Educating and 
      Mobilizing the Public to Adopt Behaviors for Community Mitigation of COVID-19: 
      Successive Sampling Design Study.
PG  - e19145

LID - e19145
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective community mitigation through voluntary behavior change is 
      currently the best way to reduce mortality caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). 
      This study builds on our prior study based on the scientific premise that YouTube is 
      one of the most effective ways to communicate and mobilize the public in community 
      mitigation to reduce exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVE: Because of the rapidly changing nature of YouTube in the 
      context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a follow-up study to document how 
      coverage of preventive behaviors for effective community mitigation has changed. 
      METHODS: A successive sampling design was used to compare coverage of behaviors to 
      mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the 100 most widely viewed YouTube 
      videos in January 2020 and March 2020. RESULTS: Videos in the January and March 
      samples were viewed &gt;125 million times and &gt;355 million times, respectively. Fewer 
      than half of the videos in either sample covered any of the prevention behaviors 
      recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but many covered 
      key prevention behaviors and were very widely viewed. There were no videos uploaded 
      by entertainment television in the January sample, but this source comprised the 
      majority of videos and garnered the majority of cumulative views in the March 
      sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the incredible reach of YouTube and the 
      potential value of partnership with the entertainment industry for communicating and 
      mobilizing the public about community mitigation to reduce mortality from the 
      COVID-19 viral pandemic.

TI  - The Role of the Global Health Development/Eastern Mediterranean Public Health 
      Network and the Eastern Mediterranean Field Epidemiology Training Programs in 
      Preparedness for COVID-19.
PG  - e18503

LID - e18503
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 a public health 
      emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Countries in the Eastern 
      Mediterranean Region (EMR) have a high vulnerability and variable capacity to 
      respond to outbreaks. Many of these countries addressed the need for increasing 
      capacity in the areas of surveillance and rapid response to public health threats. 
      Moreover, countries addressed the need for communication strategies that direct the 
      public to actions for self- and community protection. This viewpoint article aims to 
      highlight the contribution of the Global Health Development (GHD)/Eastern 
      Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) and the EMR's Field Epidemiology 
      Training Program (FETPs) to prepare for and respond to the current COVID-19 threat. 
      GHD/EMPHNET has the scientific expertise to contribute to elevating the level of 
      country alert and preparedness in the EMR and to provide technical support through 
      health promotion, training and training materials, guidelines, coordination, and 
      communication. The FETPs are currently actively participating in surveillance and 
      screening at the ports of entry, development of communication materials and 
      guidelines, and sharing information to health professionals and the public. However, 
      some countries remain ill-equipped, have poor diagnostic capacity, and are in need 
      of further capacity development in response to public health threats. It is 
      essential that GHD/EMPHNET and FETPs continue building the capacity to respond to 
      COVID-19 and intensify support for preparedness and response to public health 
      emergencies.

LID - 5616
AB  - (1) Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      began spreading across the globe in December and, as of 9 July 2020, had inflicted 
      more than 550,000 deaths. Public health measures implemented to control the outbreak 
      caused socio-economic havoc in many countries. The pandemic highlighted the quality 
      of health care systems, responses of policymakers in harmony with the population, 
      and socio-economic resilience factors. We suggest that different national strategies 
      had an impact on mortality and case count. (2) Methods: We collected fatality data 
      for 17 countries until 2 June 2020 from public data and associated these with 
      implemented containment measures. (3) Results: The outcomes present the 
      effectiveness of control mechanisms in mitigating the virus for selected countries 
      and the UAE as a special case. Pre-existing conditions defined the needed public 
      health strategies and fatality numbers. Other pre-existing conditions, such as 
      temperature, humidity, median age, and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) 
      concentrations played minor roles and may have had no direct impact on fatality 
      rates. (4) Conclusions: Prevention, fast containment, adequate public health 
      strategies, and importance of indoor environments were determining factors in 
      mitigating the pandemic. Development of public health strategies adapted to 
      pre-existing conditions for each country and community compliance with implemented 
      policies ensure the successful control of pandemics.

AB  - Because of its proximity to and frequent travelers to and from China, Taiwan faces 
      complex challenges in preventing coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As soon as China 
      reported the unidentified outbreak to the World Health Organization on December 31, 
      2019, Taiwan assembled a taskforce and began health checks onboard flights from 
      Wuhan. Taiwan's rapid implementation of disease prevention measures helped detect 
      and isolate the country's first COVID-19 case on January 20, 2020. Laboratories in 
      Taiwan developed 4-hour test kits and isolated 2 strains of the coronavirus before 
      February. Taiwan effectively delayed and contained community transmission by 
      leveraging experience from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, 
      prevalent public awareness, a robust public health network, support from healthcare 
      industries, cross-departmental collaborations, and advanced information technology 
      capacity. We analyze use of the National Health Insurance database and critical 
      policy decisions made by Taiwan's government during the first 50 days of the 
      COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health 
      emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a 
      pandemic in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries 
      to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread. Unfortunately, there is 
      no medication that has been approved by the FDA, gone through controlled studies and 
      demonstrated an effect on the virus for this global pandemic. Although there are 
      cures for illnesses and developments made by leaps and bounds in our day, the 
      strongest and most effective weapon that society has against this virus that is 
      affecting not just health but also economics, politics, and social order, is the 
      prevention of its spread. The main points in preventing the spread in society are 
      hand hygiene, social distancing and quarantine. With increased testing capacity, 
      detecting more COVID-19 positive patients in the community will also enable the 
      reduction of secondary cases with stricter quarantine rules.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      outbreak. Southeast Asia was the first region to be affected outside China, and 
      although COVID-19 cases have been reported in all countries of Southeast Asia, both 
      the policies and epidemic trajectories differ substantially, potentially due to 
      marked differences in social distancing measures that have been implemented by 
      governments in the region. This paper studies the across-country relationships 
      between social distancing and each population's response to policy, the subsequent 
      effects of these responses to the transmissibility and epidemic trajectories of 
      SARS-CoV-2. The analysis couples COVID-19 case counts with real-time mobility data 
      across Southeast Asia to estimate the effects of host population response to social 
      distancing policy and the subsequent effects on the transmissibility and epidemic 
      trajectories of SARS-CoV-2. A novel inference strategy for the time-varying 
      reproduction number is developed to allow explicit inference of the effects of 
      social distancing on the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 through a regression 
      structure. This framework replicates the observed epidemic trajectories across most 
      Southeast Asian countries, provides estimates of the effects of social distancing on 
      the transmissibility of disease and can simulate epidemic histories conditional on 
      changes in the degree of intervention scenarios and compliance within Southeast 
      Asia.

AB  - In a few devastating short months in 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      pandemic changed global mobility and interaction in ways that were unimaginable to 
      much of the world's population as recently as in 2019. More than 10 million people 
      have, at this writing, been infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) globally, and more than 850,000 have died of COVID-19. As 
      our science progresses, it is becoming possible to apply the principles of 
      population health science to help us better understand the pandemic. What does a 
      formal approach to population health science teach us about COVID-19? Building on 
      our previously published work about the foundations of population health, we offer a 
      few observations-a first draft of population health science thinking-as it 
      intersects with the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, our collective understanding of the 
      pathology and causes of COVID-19 are rapidly changing by the day, and thus we fully 
      expect that this work will evolve and improve as science progresses.

TI  - Health Communication Through News Media During the Early Stage of the COVID-19 
      Outbreak in China: Digital Topic Modeling Approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a few coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were first 
      reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were 
      detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. 
      As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in 
      community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel 
      coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and 
      investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role 
      of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China. METHODS: We adopted the 
      WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from 
      major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and 
      analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a 
      suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent 
      Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated 
      corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different 
      themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: After 
      removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant 
      news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the 
      coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics' 
      themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes 
      based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were 
      prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or 
      local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% 
      (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the 
      significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of 
      articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news 
      reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes 
      accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society 
      rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and 
      society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health 
      among others. We recommend that future work addresses the mass media's actual impact 
      on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, recorded its first 
      confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on 23 January 2020. We reviewed 
      the case epidemiology and the various public health measures implemented from 
      January to May 2020. METHODS: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 
      the cases recorded in different phases of the epidemic were described and compared, 
      and the effectiveness of the public health measures implemented were reviewed using 
      the changes in the daily number of confirmed cases and the interval from symptom 
      onset to hospital admission. RESULTS: Between January and May 2020, 1084 confirmed 
      COVID-19 cases were reported, about 70% of which had a history of travel during the 
      incubation period. The case fatality ratio was 0.4%. The local epidemic progressed 
      through four phases: (1) preparedness and imported infection from mainland China, 
      (2) local transmission, (3) imported infection from overseas countries associated 
      with local transmission, and (4) controlled imported infection with limited local 
      transmission, with an eventual reduction of the daily case number and minimization 
      of the onset-to-admission interval. Various public health measures, including 
      enhanced surveillance, border control, and social distancing, were introduced in 
      phases in response to the prevailing local and global situations. DISCUSSION: The 
      overall containment strategy in Hong Kong led to a stabilization of the number of 
      cases and the absence of a community-wide outbreak during the 4.5 m after the first 
      case was reported. This strategy of containment might serve as an example for future 
      planning of preparedness and response against novel infectious agents.

AB  - On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of acute 
      respiratory illness in persons associated with the Hunan seafood and animal market 
      in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China. On January 7, 2020, Chinese 
      health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with 
      this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, 
      including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been 
      reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been 
      reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some 
      person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been 
      reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
      Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health 
      Emergency of International Concern.(†) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health 
      and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to 
      respond to 2019-nCoV.(§) Also on January 31, the president of the United States 
      signed a "Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of 
      Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus," which limits entry 
      into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens 
      and lawful permanent residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal 
      agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing 
      aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). 
      These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United 
      States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland 
      China to the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of 
      additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not 
      prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus 
      in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 
      2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be 
      ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) 
      better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and 
      the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and 
      vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely. As more is 
      learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new 
      knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the 
      capital of China's Hubei province and has rapidly spread all over the world. The 
      World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health 
      Emergency of International Concern on 01/30/2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on 
      03/11/2020. The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide crossed the one 
      million mark on 04/02/2020; two million mark on 04/15/2020; three million mark on 
      04/27/2020 and the four million mark on 05/09/2020. Despite containment efforts, 
      more than 187 countries have been affected with more than 4,178,346 cases in the 
      world with maximum being in USA (1,347,936) followed by 227,436 in Spain and 224,422 
      in United Kingdom as of May, 2020. COVID-19 is the latest threat to face mankind 
      cutting across geographical barriers in a rapidly changing landscape. This review 
      provides an update on a rapidly evolving global pandemic. As we face the threat of 
      emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, this is a stark reminder to invest in 
      population health, climate change countermeasures, a global health surveillance 
      system and effective research into identifying pathogens, their treatment and 
      prevention and effective health delivery systems.

AB  - There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus 
      disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which 
      originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 
      countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased pressure to 
      stop the outbreak from spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, 
      preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk 
      assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should 
      include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the 
      investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical 
      manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of 
      coronavirus.

TI  - Stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology during the novel coronavirus 
      outbreak: an experience from Hong Kong.
PG  - 1049-1055

AB  - PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly emerged as a global health 
      threat. The purpose of this article is to share our local experience of stepping up 
      infection control measures in ophthalmology to minimise COVID-19 infection of both 
      healthcare workers and patients. METHODS: Infection control measures implemented in 
      our ophthalmology clinic are discussed. The measures are based on detailed risk 
      assessment by both local ophthalmologists and infection control experts. RESULTS: A 
      three-level hierarchy of control measures was adopted. First, for administrative 
      control, in order to lower patient attendance, text messages with an enquiry 
      phone number were sent to patients to reschedule appointments or arrange drug 
      refill. In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage system was set up 
      to identify patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute conjunctivitis or 
      recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these individuals to postpone their 
      appointments for at least 14 days. Micro-aerosol generating procedures, such as 
      non-contact tonometry and operations under general anaesthesia were avoided. Nasal 
      endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing and cause generation of droplets. 
      All elective clinical services were suspended. Infection control training was 
      provided to all clinical staff. Second, for environmental control, to reduce droplet 
      transmission of COVID-19, installation of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent 
      disinfection of equipment, and provision of eye protection to staff were 
      implemented. All staff were advised to measure their own body temperatures before 
      work and promptly report any symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting 
      or diarrhoea. Third, universal masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of 
      personal protective equipment (PPE) were promoted. CONCLUSION: We hope our initial 
      experience in stepping up infection control measures for COVID-19 infection in 
      ophthalmology can help ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential 
      community outbreak or pandemic. In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, 
      ophthalmologists should work closely with local infection control teams to implement 
      infection control measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.

TI  - Historical and methodological highlights of quarantine measures: from ancient plague 
      epidemics to current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

AB  - The ongoing 2020 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an enormous challenge 
      for the health systems and the entire societies of the countries involved. Since at 
      present the outbreak continues to evolve (April 2020), the World Health Organization 
      (WHO) has declared it a public health emergency of international concern, specifying 
      that public health interventions aimed at the prevention of the further spread of 
      this disease include quarantine. Quarantine, that may be defined as a restraint on 
      the activities of people or on the traffic of goods, targeted to the prevention of 
      the diffusion of communicable pathologies, is a health concept profoundly rooted in 
      the history of mankind. The lessons of the past are always pertinent for the present 
      and for the future, in particular from a public health standpoint. One of the most 
      relevant of them is connected with previous influenza pandemics, similar to the 
      current COVID-19 2019/2020 pandemic, and it indicates that it is practically 
      impossible, even in recent times, to contain the infection in the geographic area 
      where it has risen and to prevent its trans-national disseminated spread. With 
      specific reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, health authorities still 
      adopt "classical" preventive interventions, namely workplace social distancing 
      measures and quarantine, to reduce the transmission of the disease. Only the future 
      will testify the precise overall effectiveness of preventive public health measures 
      in containing the impact of the present coronavirus pandemic. However, what in this 
      epidemiological scenario is already known, is that the multi-century international 
      health value of quarantine remains essential and unavoidable.

AB  - In recent years, the prevalence and spread of coronavirus has had a huge impact on 
      global public health. Due to the incomplete understanding of the pathogenic 
      mechanism of the virus, it is difficult for humans to fight against the virus 
      quickly and effectively once the outbreak occurs. In early 2020, a novel coronavirus 
      was discovered in Wuhan, China. Soon after, similar cases were found in other 
      countries around the world, and the number of infected people increased rapidly. So 
      far, the global cumulative number of infected people has exceeded 3 million, and 
      more than 200,000 people have died, which has had a huge impact on global human 
      health and economic development. Every outbreak of disease makes a deep impression 
      on mankind. Herein, we summarize the virology, epidemiology, clinical 
      manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2, and hope that 
      countries can control the outbreak as soon as possible to minimize the loss.

TI  - Modeling Impact of Word of Mouth and E-Government on Online Social Presence during 
      COVID-19 Outbreak: A Multi-Mediation Approach.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17082954 [doi]
LID - 2954
AB  - Although social presence plays an essential role under general conditions, its role 
      becomes significant for societal protection during the quarantine period in epidemic 
      outbreak. In this study, we attempted to identify the role of E-government and 
      COVID-19 word of mouth in terms of their direct impact on online social presence 
      during the outbreak as well as their impacts mediated by epidemic protection and 
      attitudes toward epidemic outbreaks. For this purpose, a unique multi-mediation 
      model is proposed to provide a new direction for research in the field of epidemic 
      outbreaks and their control. Through random sampling, an online survey was conducted 
      and data from 683participants were analyzed. Partial least squares structural 
      equation modeling was used to test the relationships between the variables of 
      interest. The study results revealed that the roles of E-government and COVID-19 
      word of mouth are positively related to online social presence during the outbreak. 
      Epidemic protection and attitude toward epidemic outbreak were found to positively 
      moderate the impact of the role of E-government and COVID-19 word of mouth on online 
      social presence during the outbreak. The key findings of this study have both 
      practical and academic implications.

AB  - Since mid-December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) has outbroken in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly to 
      other provinces in China and dozens of countries and regions around the world, 
      becoming the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (Public Health 
      Emergency of International Concern). SARS-CoV-2 can mainly transmit by droplets or 
      close contact, and is generally susceptible in the crowd. Tumor patients are at high 
      risk of this pathogen because of their impaired immune function. Identifying tumor 
      patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) early, and understanding its 
      distribution characteristics can help to improve the cure rate of patients, and 
      better control the epidemic and development of SARS-CoV-2 much better. With 
      comprehensive analysis of relevant literature, this paper reviews the clinical 
      characteristics of neoplastic patients with COVID-19, and puts forward some 
      suggestions on how to deal with this epidemic.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World 
      Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine 
      nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in 
      combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to 
      COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the 
      spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as 
      quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of 
      these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using 
      mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions 
      in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant 
      region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction 
      numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to 
      carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters 
      contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out 
      using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy 
      necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and 
      numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number 
      of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. 
      These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days 
      of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these 
      interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, 
      the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though 
      zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple 
      interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest 
      minimum.

AB  - Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early December 2019, 81 174 confirmed 
      cases and 3242 deaths have been reported in China as of March 19, 2020. The Chinese 
      people and government have contributed huge efforts to combat this disease, 
      resulting in significant improvement of the situation, with 58 new cases (34 were 
      imported cases) and 11 new deaths reported on March 19, 2020. However, as of March 
      19, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop in 167 countries/territories 
      outside of China, and 128 665 confirmed cases and 5536 deaths have been reported, 
      with 16 498 new cases and 817 new deaths occurring in last 24 hours. Therefore, the 
      world should work together to fight against this pandemic. Here, we review the 
      recent advances in COVID-19, including the insights in the virus, the responses of 
      the host cells, the cytokine release syndrome, and the therapeutic approaches to 
      inhibit the virus and alleviate the cytokine storm. By sharing knowledge and 
      deepening our understanding of the virus and the disease pathogenesis, we believe 
      that the community can efficiently develop effective vaccines and drugs, and the 
      mankind will eventually win this battle against this pandemic.

AB  - The novel human coronavirus disease COVID-19 has become the fifth documented 
      pandemic since the 1918 flu pandemic. COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, 
      and subsequently spread worldwide. The coronavirus was officially named severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on 
      Taxonomy of Viruses based on phylogenetic analysis. SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a 
      spillover of an animal coronavirus and later adapted the ability of human-to-human 
      transmission. Because the virus is highly contagious, it rapidly spreads and 
      continuously evolves in the human population. In this review article, we discuss the 
      basic properties, potential origin, and evolution of the novel human coronavirus. 
      These factors may be critical for studies of pathogenicity, antiviral designs, and 
      vaccine development against the virus.

      during the subsequent weeks. The pathogen was identified quickly and was named as 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The infectious disease 
      caused by this virus is referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Within 
      months, it has caused a global pandemic and posed a major threat to public health 
      worldwide. As of May 23, 2020, 5 252 452 patients have been confirmed to have the 
      disease, and 339 026 deaths have been reported. Multiple therapeutic trials are 
      ongoing, and some promising results have been released. A vaccine would provide the 
      most effective approach to fight the virus by preventing infection, but none are 
      currently available. To control the COVID-19 outbreak, large-scale measures have 
      been applied to reduce human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Susceptible 
      populations, including older adults, children, and healthcare providers, warrant 
      particular attention to avoid transmission and infection. This review introduces 
      current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment strategies, emphasizing 
      the relevant challenges associated with prevention, diagnosis, and management.

TI  - Systematic Review of Clinical Insights into Novel Coronavirus (CoVID-19) Pandemic: 
      Persisting Challenges in U.S. Rural Population.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17124279 [doi]
LID - 4279
AB  - (1) Introduction. A recent viral outbreak of novel coronavirus (CoVID-19) was 
      declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its global 
      public health concern. There has been an aggressive growth in the number of emerging 
      cases suggesting rapid spread of the virus. Since the first reported case of 
      CoVID-19, there has been vast progress in understanding the dynamics of CoVID-19. 
      However, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease 
      burden between urban and rural areas, with rural areas having minimal pandemic 
      preparedness and their own healthcare challenges. Therefore, this review aims to 
      provide insight on the pathogenesis and the transmission dynamics of CoVID-19 along 
      with pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention strategies to mitigate the 
      clinical manifestation of this virus. This review also aims to assess existing 
      challenges of the CoVID-19 pandemic in rural areas based on past pandemic 
      experiences and the effect on rural population. (2) Methods. A literature review was 
      conducted using databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, 
      ProQuest, and Google Scholar, along with information from governmental organizations 
      such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health 
      Organization (WHO). (3) Results. The causative virus, with its likely zoonotic 
      origin, has demonstrated high pathogenicity in humans through increasing 
      human-to-human transmission leading to extensive mitigation strategies, including 
      patient quarantine and mass "social distancing" measures. Although the clinical 
      manifestation of symptoms is mild in majority of the virus-inflicted population, 
      critical patients may present with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome, exacerbated by pre-existing comorbidities, eventually leading to death. 
      While effective coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-specific vaccines and drugs are under 
      clinical trials, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have 
      been adapted to manage symptoms and curtail the effect of the virus to prevent 
      increasing morbidity and mortality. Several persisting challenges have been noted 
      for mitigating CoVID-19 in rural areas, including the poor healthcare 
      infrastructure, health literacy, pandemic preparedness along with the fact that 
      majority of rural population are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities. (4) 
      Discussion. The increasing rate of incidence of CoVID-19 presents its own 
      challenges, burdening healthcare institutions and the global economy, and impacting 
      the physical and mental health of people worldwide. Given the clinical insights into 
      CoVID-19 and the challenges presented in this review for the U.S. rural population, 
      mitigation strategies should be designed accordingly to minimize the morbidity and 
      mortality of this contagion.

AB  - Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 12 April 2020: notifications = 6,394; 
      deaths = 46. The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social 
      distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the 
      disease. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent 
      overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most 
      locally-acquired cases are able to be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small 
      portion unable to be epidemiologically linked. The distribution of overseas-acquired 
      cases to locally acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. Internationally, cases 
      continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, 
      although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. The 
      epidemiology differs from country to country depending not only on the disease, but 
      also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health 
      measures.

AB  - Integrating risk communication and community engagement into the national public 
      health emergency response is crucial. Considering the difficulties and challenges 
      faced by China in the prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and 
      based on interim guidelines from the World Health Organization, this article makes 
      several recommendations addressing the outbreak in China. These include improvements 
      in the internal governmental risk communication systems, enhancing the coordination 
      between internal and partner governmental emergency management, and promoting public 
      communication in response to societal concerns. Regarding these recommendations, we 
      emphasize community engagement in joint prevention and control, confronting 
      uncertainty and countering rumors effectively, and strengthening international 
      cooperation and evidence-based decision making for prevention and control measures.

AB  - The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak is having a profound impact on the 
      management of patients with cancer. In this review, we comprehensively investigate 
      the various aspects of cancer care during the pandemic, taking advantage of data 
      generated in Asia and Europe at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic spread. 
      Cancer wards have been subjected to several modifications to protect patients and 
      healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infection, while attempting to maintain 
      cancer diagnosis, therapy, and research. In this setting, the management of COVID-19 
      infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging. We also discuss the 
      direct and potential remote impacts of the global pandemic on the mortality of 
      patients with cancer. As such, the indirect impact of the pandemic on the global 
      economy and the potential consequences in terms of cancer mortality are discussed. 
      As the infection is spreading worldwide, we are obtaining more knowledge on the 
      COVID-19 pandemic consequences that are currently impacting and may continue to 
      further challenge cancer care in several countries.

AB  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle East 
      since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, a 
      cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, 
      linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic 
      agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with 
      international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid national 
      and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies 
      have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee to declare the 
      disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 
      2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV community cases and 
      hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge for HCWs to deal with 
      both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of standardized and approved point of 
      care testing. This challenge will now be faced by the whole global health community 
      dealing with COVID-19 since both coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those 
      patients should now be tested for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and 
      with the continuing wide international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to 
      China in the last 14 days will be of less significance.

TI  - Public perspectives on protective measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in the 
      Netherlands, Germany and Italy: A survey study.
PG  - e0236917

LID - e0236917
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent to which people implement government-issued protective 
      measures is critical in preventing further spread of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our study aimed to describe the public 
      belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported implementation of 
      these measures, and to identify communication channels used to acquire information 
      on COVID-19 in European countries during the early stage of the pandemic. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: An online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated 
      starting on March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics 
      for countries with more than 500 respondents. Each day, we assessed enacted 
      community containment measures by stage of stringency (I-IV). In total, 9,796 adults 
      responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604 in Germany 
      (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). To explore possible dynamics as 
      containment strategies intensified, we also included 1,365 responses submitted 
      during the following week. Participants indicated support for governmental measures 
      related to avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public places, and hand 
      hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures: 95.0%-99.7%). Respondents 
      from the Netherlands less frequently considered a complete social lockdown effective 
      (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian 
      residents applied enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 
      90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch residents: 67.5%-97.0%) and self-initiated hygienic 
      and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 
      28.3%-95.7%). Respondents reported being sufficiently informed about the outbreak 
      and behaviors to avoid infection (range: 90.2%-91.1%). Information channels most 
      commonly reported included television newspapers, official health websites, and 
      social media. One week later, we observed no major differences in submitted 
      responses. CONCLUSIONS: During the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, belief in 
      the effectiveness of protective measures among survey respondents from three 
      European countries was high and participants reported feeling sufficiently informed. 
      In March 2020, implementation of measures differed between countries and were 
      highest among respondents from Italy, who were subjected to the most stringent 
      lockdown measures and greatest COVID-19 burden in Europe during this period.

AB  - Physical/social distancing, handwashing, respiratory hygiene and face-masking have 
      been recommended as realistic counterstrategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      These strategies have been critical in the fight against the present pandemic in 
      many countries. Here we detail the background to such countermeasures, present some 
      examples in different settings and finally emphasise that they should remain in 
      place worldwide as a cultural and behavioural "new normal" until a vaccine or a 
      decisive treatment for COVID-19 is developed and made available globally.

AB  - In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was reported by China to WHO. The 
      outbreak was found to be caused by a coronavirus which was officially named "severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease caused by it 
      was named 'COVID-19'. The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23rd January 
      2020. With lessons learnt from the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the H1N1 flu pandemic 
      in 2009, Singapore was much better prepared to deal with the virus outbreak. The 
      government has taken swift measures to contain and break the chain of transmission. 
      Healthcare workers face the challenge of keeping patients and staff safe from the 
      disease. There is a higher risk of mortality of COVID-19 in cancer patients and 
      hence unique considerations for a radiation oncology department operating in an 
      infectious disease outbreak. This article is the recommendations and adapted 
      workflow from the two National Cancer Centres in Singapore with the endorsement by 
      the working committee of the Chapter of Radiation Oncology, Academy of Medicine, 
      Singapore. It highlights the challenges that radiation oncology departments in 
      Singapore face and the appropriate recommended responses. This includes 
      interventions, business continuity plans and workflow in managing a COVID-19 
      positive patient on radiotherapy.

AB  - The epidemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China caused by the Severe 
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global concern 
      and subsequently labeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th. 
      As the world mobilizes to contain the COVID-19, scientists and public health experts 
      are increasingly alarmed about the potentially catastrophic effects of an outbreak 
      in Africa. The establishment of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention by 
      the Africa Union in 2017 was an unprecedented move toward strengthening national 
      responses, so far enabling all fifty member states with confirmed cases of COVID-19 
      to adequately respond, break chains of transmission and effectively contain the 
      spread of SARS-CoV-2. We enter an uncertain and challenging period that may severely 
      test the preparedness, organizational resource and resilience of African states and 
      the fabric of their societies. However, we speculate that the fear associated with 
      COVID-19 may also lead to some of the long-standing messages about simple measures 
      to reduce the spread, such as hand washing, finally becoming absorbed and more 
      universally adopted by health workers and the public. Is it possible that regardless 
      of the terrible threat posed by SARS-CoV-2, the increased adoption of these health 
      protection measures may result in a reduction in the spread of other infectious 
      diseases?

TI  - Public Health Interventions to Mitigate Early Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland.
PG  - e924730
LID - 10.12659/MSM.924730 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed (1) to present public health interventions to mitigate the early 
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 implemented in Poland between January 9 and March 29, 2020, and 
      (2) to analyze the potential impact of these regulations on the early phase of the 
      COVID-19 outbreak in Poland. All legal regulations published in the Journal of Laws 
      between January 9 and March 29, 2020, were analyzed. Out of 406 legal regulations 
      identified, 56 were related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the official 
      announcements published on the governmental websites dedicated to the coronavirus 
      and health issues were analyzed. On March 4, Poland reported the first 
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case. On March 9, Poland introduced border sanitary 
      control. Six days after the first laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, all mass 
      events in Poland were banned. All schools and universities were closed 8 days after 
      the first COVID-19 case. All gastronomic facilities and sport and entertainment 
      services were limited starting on March 14. Eleven days after the first COVID-19 
      case, controls at all Polish borders were introduced, and a ban on entry into Poland 
      by foreigners (with some exemptions) was implemented. Starting on March 15, all 
      citizens returning from abroad had to undergo compulsory 14 days self-quarantine. On 
      March 20, a state of epidemic was announced, which resulted in new social distancing 
      measures starting on March 25. In Poland, compared to other European countries, 
      far-reaching solutions were implemented relatively early to reduce the spread of 
      infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The public health burden of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) is expected to increase and urgent strict measures by decision-makers is 
      critical for the containment of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak 
      worldwide. AIMS: This study aimed to give a real-time analysis of COVID-19 presence 
      in northern Cyprus. METHODS: All official SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were tracked and 
      reported in terms of the origin, nationality, and transmission routes. Preventive 
      measures taken after the first reported case were analyzed for their effectiveness 
      as control strategies. RESULTS: The index case of SARS-CoV-2 in northern Cyprus was 
      identified as a female German tourist. First local case had travel history from the 
      United Kingdom after which local transmission occurred. Rapid and strict containment 
      measures have currently delayed a peak in observed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid 
      implementation of social-distancing measures, good hygiene measures and 
      travel/gathering bans in northern Cyprus has been effective in controlling the 
      outbreak.

PG  - 1631-1643
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2020.4555 [doi]
AB  - The new outbreak of coronavirus from December 2019 has brought attention to an old 
      viral enemy and has raised concerns as to the ability of current protection measures 
      and the healthcare system to handle such a threat. It has been known since the 1960s 
      that coronaviruses can cause respiratory infections in humans; however, their 
      epidemic potential was understood only during the past two decades. In the present 
      review, we address current knowledge on coronaviruses from a short history to 
      epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as 
      treatment and prevention strategies. Although a great amount of research and efforts 
      have been made worldwide to prevent further outbreaks of coronavirus‑associated 
      disease, the spread and lethality of the 2019 outbreak (COVID‑19) is proving to be 
      higher than previous epidemics on account of international travel density and immune 
      naivety of the population. Only strong, joint and coordinated efforts of worldwide 
      healthcare systems, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies and receptive national 
      leaders will succeed in suppressing an outbreak of this scale.

      2020. Quarantine officers, medical professionals, and administrative staff from 
      competent authorities conducted fever screening and investigated the present illness 
      and travel history of 1738 passengers and 776 crew members on the ship. Throat swabs 
      were collected from 128 (5.1%) passengers and crew members with fever or respiratory 
      symptoms during the past 14 days or travel history to China, Hong Kong, or Macao 
      within 30 days. All swabs tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 at the national reference laboratory. The whole process, from on-board 
      preparation to the completion of testing, took 9 h. All passengers and crew were 
      permitted to disembark and were required to take 14-day self-health management 
      measures. No cases were reported by the end of the self-health management period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emerging infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a 
      serious threat in China and worldwide. Challenged by this serious situation, China 
      has taken many measures to contain its transmission. This study aims to 
      systematically review and record these special and effective practices, in hope of 
      benefiting for fighting against the ongoing worldwide pandemic. METHODS: The 
      measures taken by the governments was tracked and sorted on a daily basis from the 
      websites of governmental authorities (e.g. National Health Commission of the 
      People's Republic of China). And the measures were reviewed and summarized by 
      categorizations, figures and tables, showing an ever-changing process of combating 
      with an emerging infectious disease. The population shift levels, daily local new 
      diagnosed cases, daily mortality and daily local new cured cases were used for 
      measuring the effect of the measures. RESULTS: The practices could be categorized 
      into active case surveillance, rapid case diagnosis and management, strict follow-up 
      and quarantine of persons with close contacts, and issuance of guidance to help the 
      public understand and adhere to control measures, plus prompt and effective 
      high-level policy decision, complete activation of the public health system, and 
      full involvement of the society. Along with the measures, the population shift 
      levels, daily local new diagnosed cases, and mortality were decreased, and the daily 
      local new cured cases were increased in China. CONCLUSIONS: China's practices are 
      effective in controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Considering newly occurred 
      situations (e.g. imported cases, work resumption), the control measures may be 
      adjusted.

AB  - COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, which first 
      appeared in China in late 2019, and reached pandemic distribution in early 2020. The 
      first major outbreak in Europe occurred in Northern Italy where it spread to 
      neighboring countries, notably to Austria, where skiing resorts served as a main 
      transmission hub. Soon, the Austrian government introduced strict measures to curb 
      the spread of the virus. Using publicly available data, we assessed the efficiency 
      of the governmental measures. We assumed an average incubation period of one week 
      and an average duration of infectivity of 10 days. One week after the introduction 
      of strict measures, the increase in daily new cases was reversed, and the 
      reproduction number dropped. The crude estimates tended to overestimate the 
      reproduction rate in the early phase. Publicly available data provide a first 
      estimate about the effectiveness of public health measures. However, more data are 
      needed for an unbiased assessment.

LID - 10.4149/av_2020_201 [doi]
AB  - An outbreak of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease, 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged during December 2019. The ongoing 
      outbreak in Wuhan City spread rapidly throughout China, where the fatality 
      rate ranged from 2.1 to 4.9%. Due to its high transmissibility, the World Health 
      Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 
      January 2020. The current outbreak has the potential to become the first pandemic of 
      the new millennium. Most patients who were first diagnosed with COVID-19 worked at 
      or lived in the vicinity of the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale  Market, where live 
      animals were also on sale. The concerted efforts of Chinese scientists led to the 
      independent isolation from patients and identification of a novel coronavirus, SARS 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on 6 January 2020; this has been an important step in 
      the development of treatment. The purpose of this article is to overview the 
      history, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID 
      2019 reported in recently published studies. Based on the results of virus genome 
      sequencing and a model of the interaction between host cells and the virus, we 
      propose several possible targets for antiviral drugs, which may provide new ideas 
      for epidemic control and vaccine development. Keywords: 2019 novel coronavirus; 
      pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2; Coronaviridae; COVID-19.

AB  - An outbreak of a new coronavirus originating from Wuhan (China), responsible for a 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), called SARS-CoV-2, is causing a pandemic 
      disease called CoViD-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19), although strict containment 
      measures and restrictions on individual travel have been taken everywhere to hinder 
      the spread of the virus. The clinical spectrum of this infection includes, in order 
      of lesser to greater severity, asymptomatic viremia, paucisymptomatic forms, 
      clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that needs mechanical 
      ventilation and support in an intensive care unit, systemic manifestations of 
      infection, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. There is 
      currently no vaccine to prevent CoViD-19, but the international scientific community 
      is intensely focused on finding a vaccine that will prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 
      In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to 
      stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective 
      monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly 
      at risk of positivity of CoViD-19. Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms 
      involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of 
      the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the 
      infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention. We 
      aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as 
      possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical 
      condition and comorbidities. An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate 
      therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression 
      of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of 
      transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress.

TI  - Criminalisation of transmission of SARS-CoV-2: A potential challenge to controlling 
      the outbreak in South Africa.
PG  - 458-460
LID - 10.7196/SAMJ.2020v110i6.14753 [doi]
AB  - In March 2020, two cases of attempted murder were opened against people who had 
      tested positive for COVID-19 and had not remained in quarantine. Criminal law has 
      previously been used to criminalise intentional transmission of HIV in both South 
      Africa (SA) and other countries. However, it has been found that criminalisation 
      laws undermine public health and measures to control outbreaks by stigmatising those 
      infected and deterring testing. This article explores whether SA's existing HIV 
      criminalisation laws can be applied to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the 
      potential effect such measures could have on efforts to control the COVID-19 
      epidemic.

AB  - On 31 December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness was reported from China 
      and later confirmed as novel coronavirus on 7 January 2020. This virus is the same 
      member of the coronavirus family that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS-CoV) reported in China 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) 
      reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The initial cases have been linked to a live 
      seafood market in Wuhan, China, and the specific animal source is yet to be 
      determined. The detection of this new virus in humans without knowing the source of 
      the infection has raised greatly heightened concerns not only in China, but also 
      internationally. To date, the outbreak has spread to most provinces in China and 25 
      other countries within a relatively short period. Consequent to its spread, Dr 
      Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), 
      declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 
      30 January 2020.
