AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 80 813 
      confirmed cases in all provinces of China, and 21 110 cases reported in 93 countries 
      of six continents as of 7 March 2020 since middle December 2019. Due to biological 
      nature of the novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) with faster spreading and unknown transmission pattern, it makes us 
      in a difficulty position to contain the disease transmission globally. To date, we 
      have found it is one of the greatest challenges to human beings in fighting against 
      COVID-19 in the history, because SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 
      in terms of biological features and transmissibility, and also found the containment 
      strategies including the non-pharmaceutical public health measures implemented in 
      China are effective and successful. In order to prevent a potential pandemic-level 
      outbreak of COVID-19, we, as a community of shared future for mankind, recommend for 
      all international leaders to support preparedness in low and middle income countries 
      especially, take strong global interventions by using old approaches or new tools, 
      mobilize global resources to equip hospital facilities and supplies to protect 
      noisome infections and to provide personal protective tools such as facemask to 
      general population, and quickly initiate research projects on drug and vaccine 
      development. We also recommend for the international community to develop better 
      coordination, cooperation, and strong solidarity in the joint efforts of fighting 
      against COVID-19 spreading recommended by the joint mission report of the WHO-China 
      experts, against violating the International Health Regulation (WHO, 2005), and 
      against stigmatization, in order to eventually win the battle against our common 
      enemy - COVID-19.

TI  - What influences people's responses to public health messages for managing risks and 
      preventing infectious diseases? A rapid systematic review of the evidence and 
      recommendations.
PG  - e048750
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048750 [doi]
LID - e048750
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual behaviour changes, such as hand hygiene and physical 
      distancing, are required on a population scale to reduce transmission of infectious 
      diseases such as COVID-19. However, little is known about effective methods of 
      communicating risk reducing information, and how populations might respond. 
      OBJECTIVE: To synthesise evidence relating to what (1) characterises effective 
      public health messages for managing risk and preventing infectious disease and (2) 
      influences people's responses to messages. DESIGN: A rapid systematic review was 
      conducted. Protocol is published on Prospero CRD42020188704. DATA SOURCES: 
      Electronic databases were searched: Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO and 
      Healthevidence.org, and grey literature (PsyarXiv, OSF Preprints) up to May 2020. 
      STUDY SELECTION: All study designs that (1) evaluated public health messaging 
      interventions targeted at adults and (2) concerned a communicable disease spread via 
      primary route of transmission of respiratory and/or touch were included. Outcomes 
      included preventative behaviours, perceptions/awareness and intentions. Non-English 
      language papers were excluded. SYNTHESIS: Due to high heterogeneity studies were 
      synthesised narratively focusing on determinants of intentions in the absence of 
      measured adherence/preventative behaviours. Themes were developed independently by 
      two researchers and discussed within team to reach consensus. Recommendations were 
      translated from narrative synthesis to provide evidence-based methods in providing 
      effective messaging. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eligible papers were identified. 
      Characteristics of effective messaging include delivery by credible sources, 
      community engagement, increasing awareness/knowledge, mapping to stage of 
      epidemic/pandemic. To influence intent effectively, public health messages need to 
      be acceptable, increase understanding/perceptions of health threat and perceived 
      susceptibility. DISCUSSION: There are four key recommendations: (1) engage 
      communities in development of messaging, (2) address uncertainty immediately and 
      with transparency, (3) focus on unifying messages from sources and (4) frame 
      messages aimed at increasing understanding, social responsibility and personal 
      control. Embedding principles of behavioural science into public health messaging is 
      an important step towards more effective health-risk communication during 
      epidemics/pandemics.

AB  - The world is currently gripped by the fear of the corona virus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) pandemic. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus known as 
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that attacks humans 
      without prejudice, and primarily targets the respiratory system. Pakistan is a 
      developing country with a large population and a weak economy. Currently, it is 
      facing a major challenge to cope with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      especially the third wave. This fatal virus has increased its presence many folds in 
      Pakistan. On average, 100 deaths per day were being recorded in the late spring of 
      2021. Delay in the acquisition of vaccine has slowed down the vaccination program 
      for this disease. This in turn will accelerate the spreading of virus, and thus will 
      lead to a lockdown situation.

TI  - Compliance With Protective Behavioral Recommendations in the Outbreak of COVID-19 
      Among People Working in the Urban-Based Informal Economy in Southern Ethiopia.
PG  - 716814
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2021.716814 [doi]
LID - 716814
AB  - Regardless of the advocacies made by the media and numerous organizations about the 
      need for preventing the spread of COVID-19, there still exists a gap as far as 
      compliance to regular implementation of the preventive mechanisms within communities 
      is concerned. The purpose of the present study was, therefore, to examine compliance 
      to personal protective behavioral recommendations to contain the spread of COVID-19 
      among urban residents engaged in the informal economic activities in Wolaita Sodo 
      town, Southern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study design was used where quantitative 
      data were collected through the survey research method. Three hundred and 
      eighty-four participants of the urban-based informal economy were randomly selected 
      and contacted in their own natural settings with an interviewer-administered 
      questionnaire. Data were inserted into SPSS software for analysis that involved both 
      descriptive and inferential statistics, including frequency and percentage 
      distributions, binomial and multinomial logistic regressions. The results of the 
      research indicated that only 35.4% of the respondents regularly wore a mask. In 
      addition, 54.9% of the survey participants disclosed that they do not clean their 
      hands with disinfectants after touching objects under circumstances where they 
      cannot get access to water and soap. Moreover, the most commonly reported reason of 
      respondents for non-compliance to regular wearing of a mask has been its 
      inconvenience or discomfort (62.8%), followed by the need to appear indifferent 
      because most people around them do not wear a mask (25.2%). Furthermore, experiences 
      of the respondents of regularly wearing a mask are significantly associated with 
      regular attendance of the media regarding the preventive mechanisms of COVID-19 (OR 
      = 0.224; P &lt; 0.001; 95%C.I: 0.109-0.460), knowledge of someone ever infected by 
      COVID-19 (OR = 0.402; P &lt; 0.05; 95%C.I: 0.190-0.851), the belief that COVID-19 
      causes a severe illness (OR = 0.444; P &lt; 0.05; 95%C.I: 0.201-0.980), and perception 
      of the likelihood of dying as a result of infection by COVID-19 (OR = 0.374; P &lt; 
      0.01; 95% C.I: 0.197-0.711). The authors have found a low level of compliance to the 
      recommended safety measures, especially wearing of masks. It is, therefore, 
      important that continued efforts of raising awareness should be done by all the 
      concerned bodies. Above all, urban safety net programs that aim at keeping such 
      social groups at home, at least during the critical wave of the pandemic, should 
      also be strengthened.

TI  - The impact of economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19 on renewable energy stocks.
PG  - 1-21
LID - 10.1007/s00181-021-02087-3 [doi]
AB  - By employing time-frequency-domain frameworks, this study analyzes the spillover 
      effects of news-based economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic on three renewable 
      energy stock indices in the USA, Europe, and the world. The empirical results reveal 
      that the total spillover from economic uncertainty to the three renewable energy 
      stock returns was concentrated at a high frequency, whereas those to volatilities 
      appeared at low frequencies. Utilizing a rolling-window method, we observed that the 
      impact of uncertainty caused by COVID-19 on three renewable energy stock returns and 
      volatilities is more significant than that resulting from the global financial 
      crisis (GFC). During COVID-19, the majority of the spillover effects from economic

      Neurotropism and Possible Relevance to Parkinson's Disease.
PG  - 670298

AB  - Since December 2019, humankind has been experiencing a ravaging severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, the second coronavirus 
      pandemic in a decade after the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      (MERS-CoV) disease in 2012. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in Coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19), which is responsible for over 3.1 million deaths worldwide. With 
      the emergence of a second and a third wave of infection across the globe, and the 
      rising record of multiple reinfections and relapses, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows no 
      sign of abating. In addition, it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 infection presents 
      with neurological symptoms that include early hyposmia, ischemic stroke, meningitis, 
      delirium and falls, even after viral clearance. This may suggest chronic or 
      permanent changes to the neurons, glial cells, and/or brain vasculature in response 
      to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Within the central nervous system (CNS), 
      microglia act as the central housekeepers against altered homeostatic states, 
      including during viral neurotropic infections. In this review, we highlight 
      microglial responses to viral neuroinfections, especially those with a similar 
      genetic composition and route of entry as SARS-CoV-2. As the primary sensor of viral 
      infection in the CNS, we describe the pathogenic and neuroinvasive mechanisms of RNA 
      viruses and SARS-CoV-2 vis-à-vis the microglial means of viral recognition. 
      Responses of microglia which may culminate in viral clearance or immunopathology are 
      also covered. Lastly, we further discuss the implication of SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion 
      on microglial plasticity and associated long-term neurodegeneration. As such, this 
      review provides insight into some of the mechanisms by which microglia could 
      contribute to the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae and 
      disorders, including Parkinson's disease, which could be pervasive in the coming 
      years given the growing numbers of infected and re-infected individuals globally.

AB  - The newly found SARS-CoV-2 has led to the pandemic of COVID-19, which has caused 
      respiratory distress syndrome and even death worldwide. This has become a global 
      public health crisis. Unfortunately, elders and subjects with comorbidities have 
      high mortality rates. One main feature of COVID-19 is the cytokine storm, which can 
      cause damage in cells and tissues including the kidneys. Here, we reviewed the 
      current literature on renal impairments in patients with COVID-19 and analyzed the 
      possible etiology and mechanisms. In addition, we investigated the potential use of 
      vitamin C for the prevention of renal injury in those patients. It appears that 
      vitamin C could be helpful to improve the outcomes of patients with COVID-19. 
      Lastly, we discussed the possible protective effects of vitamin C on renal functions 
      in COVID-19 patients with existing kidney conditions.

      Beyond the Hype.

AB  - COVID-19 has created enormous suffering, affecting lives, and causing deaths. The 
      ease with which this type of coronavirus can spread has exposed weaknesses of many 
      healthcare systems around the world. Since its emergence, many governments, research 
      communities, commercial enterprises, and other institutions and stakeholders around 
      the world have been fighting in various ways to curb the spread of the disease. 
      Science and technology have helped in the implementation of policies of many 
      governments that are directed toward mitigating the impacts of the pandemic and in 
      diagnosing and providing care for the disease. Recent technological tools, 
      artificial intelligence (AI) tools in particular, have also been explored to track 
      the spread of the coronavirus, identify patients with high mortality risk and 
      diagnose patients for the disease. In this paper, areas where AI techniques are 
      being used in the detection, diagnosis and epidemiological predictions, forecasting 
      and social control for combating COVID-19 are discussed, highlighting areas of 
      successful applications and underscoring issues that need to be addressed to achieve 
      significant progress in battling COVID-19 and future pandemics. Several AI systems 
      have been developed for diagnosing COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities such as 
      chest CT and X-ray images. These AI systems mainly differ in their choices of the 
      algorithms for image segmentation, classification and disease diagnosis. Other 
      AI-based systems have focused on predicting mortality rate, long-term patient 
      hospitalization and patient outcomes for COVID-19. AI has huge potential in the 
      battle against the COVID-19 pandemic but successful practical deployments of these 
      AI-based tools have so far been limited due to challenges such as limited data 
      accessibility, the need for external evaluation of AI models, the lack of awareness 
      of AI experts of the regulatory landscape governing the deployment of AI tools in 
      healthcare, the need for clinicians and other experts to work with AI experts in a 
      multidisciplinary context and the need to address public concerns over data 
      collection, privacy, and protection. Having a dedicated team with expertise in 
      medical data collection, privacy, access and sharing, using federated learning 
      whereby AI scientists hand over training algorithms to the healthcare institutions 
      to train models locally, and taking full advantage of biomedical data stored in 
      biobanks can alleviate some of problems posed by these challenges. Addressing these 
      challenges will ultimately accelerate the translation of AI research into practical 
      and useful solutions for combating pandemics.

AB  - Since the first case of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, 
      China, in December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has quickly spread to 
      all the corners of the world. Amid the global public health threats posed by the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, active cooperative governance has gradually emerged as the most 
      powerful weapon against its spread. To facilitate international cooperation for 
      pandemic governance, this paper applied the evolutionary game theory to analyze the 
      factors influencing active cooperative governance and, based on the results, 
      proposed a series of recommendations for promoting international cooperation. (1) 
      leveraging the role of international organizations to reduce the cost of realizing 
      the strategy of active cooperative governance, (2) promoting the international 
      exchange of related experiences to lower the cost of active pandemic governance, (3) 
      sustaining productive and daily activities during the pandemic in a classified and 
      hierarchical manner to reduce the economic loss incurred by active pandemic 
      governance, and (4) optimizing the incentive measures of international organizations 
      to facilitate the selection of active cooperative governance. Finally, from the four 
      aspects of resource management of pandemic treatment, supply management of living 
      materials, population flow cooperation management, and governance fund cooperation 
      management, this paper gives the path of international pandemic cooperative 
      governance.

LID - e0250940
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of a pandemic presents challenges and opportunities for 
      healthcare, health promotion interventions, and overall improvement in healthcare 
      seeking behaviour. This study explored the impact of COVID-19 on health knowledge, 
      lifestyle, and healthcare seeking behaviour among residents of a resource-limited 
      setting in Ghana. METHODS: This qualitative study adopted an exploratory design to 
      collect data from 20 adult residents in the Cape Coast Metropolis using face-to-face 
      in-depth interviews. Data collected were analysed thematically and statements from 
      participants presented verbatim to illustrate the themes realised. RESULTS: Health 
      knowledge has improved due to COVID-19 in terms of access to health information and 
      increased understanding of health issues. There were reductions in risky 
      health-related lifestyles (alcohol intake, sharing of personal items, and 
      consumption of junk foods) while improvements were observed in healthy lifestyles 
      such as regular physical exercise and increased consumption of fruits and 
      vegetables. COVID-19 also positively impacted health seeking behaviour through 
      increased health consciousness and regular check-ups. However, reduced healthcare 
      utilization was prevalent. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a 
      positive cue to action and helped improved health knowledge, lifestyle, and care 
      seeking behaviour although existing health system constrains and low economic status 
      reduced healthcare utilization. To improve health systems, health-related lifestyles 
      and healthcare seeking behaviour as well as overall health outcomes even after the 
      pandemic wades off, COVID-19 associated conscious and unconscious reforms should be 
      systematically harnessed.

AB  - Despite the international scientific community's commitment to improve clinical 
      knowledge about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), knowledge regarding molecular 
      details remains limited. In this review, we discuss hypoxia's potential role in the 
      pathogenesis of the maladaptive immune reaction against severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The state of infection, with serious 
      respiratory dysfunction, causes tissues to become hypoxic due to a discrepancy 
      between cellular O(2) uptake and consumption similar to that seen within tumor 
      tissue during the progression of numerous solid cancers. In this context, the 
      heterogeneous clinical behavior and the multiorgan deterioration of COVID-19 are 
      discussed as a function of the upregulated expression of the hypoxia-inducible 
      factor-1 (HIF-1) and of the metabolic reprogramming associated with HIF-1 and with a 
      proinflammatory innate immune response activation, independent of the increase in 
      the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Possible pharmacological strategies targeting O(2) 
      aimed to improve prognosis are suggested.

TI  - Psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on nurses working in tertiary women's 
      and children's hospitals from Sichuan, China: A cross-sectional study.
PG  - 102188

AB  - The evolving COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented pressures on health systems. 
      Accumulative studies suggest that nurses were more likely to develop negative 
      psychiatric outcomes following a public health disaster than other medical staffs, 
      due to their more frequent and closer contact with patients. We examined the 
      psychological status of nurses working in the tertiary women's and children's 
      hospitals in Sichuan, China, in order to explore the possible effect of the 
      COVID-19. The cross-sectional survey was conducted at the peak period of COVID-19 
      among 1971 nurses. Their anxiety, depression and self-efficacy were assessed by the 
      seven-item anxiety scale (GAD-7), the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-9), and the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES), respectively. 1934 valid 
      questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 98.1%. We found that 29.3% and 
      22.7% of the nurses were identified with anxiety and depressive symptoms, 
      respectively. The median score of GSES was 30, which was at the upper middle level 
      among all populations. Nurses having longer working years and cold-like symptoms, 
      those who were at work during breakout period and working in pediatric ward were 
      significantly associated with the presence of anxiety and depression. Findings 
      suggest that the epidemic of COVID-19 does not necessarily affect the psychological 
      health of nurses working in women's and children's hospitals in Sichuan. The results 
      of this study could serve as valuable suggestions to direct the promotion of 
      psychological well-being among targeted nurses.

AB  - The review summarizes chloroquine (CQ) and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine 
      (HCQ) and its utility in Covid-19. Recently this well-established drug made its way 
      back to the headlines during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This led to an upsurge in the 
      scientific arena with multiple research and review articles along with expert 
      opinions and commentaries. The HCQ has received mixed judgements so far about its 
      efficacy to be used in Covid-19 patients in a limited trial conducted all across the 
      Globe. The purpose of our article is to put forth the history, pharmacodynamics, and 
      pharmacokinetics, along with the existing studies favouring and disapproving the 
      role of HCQ in the treatment of Covid-19. We grouped HCQ use at three stages, this 
      includes HCQ for i. prophylactic use by asymptomatic health workers or peoples at 
      higher risk; ii. patients having mild symptoms; iii. patients with extreme symptoms. 
      The review critically discusses the underlying plausible reasons and mechanisms 
      exploring HCQ in prophylactic management or treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we 
      have critically analysed the reported pharmacokinetic parameters and compiled the 
      proponent, opponent, or neutral opinions on the use of HCQ in Covid-19. Authors 
      discretion is to conduct more studies considering the optimal dosing regimen and 
      pharmacokinetics assessment.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has ravaged the world's socioeconomic systems 
      forcing many governments across the globe to implement unprecedented stringent 
      mitigation measures to restrain its rapid spread and adverse effects. A 
      disproportionate number of COVID-19 related morbidities and mortalities were 
      predicted to occur in Africa. However, Africa still has a lower than predicted 
      number of cases, 4% of the global pandemic burden. In this open letter, we highlight 
      some of the early stringent countermeasures implemented in Kenya, a sub-Saharan 
      African country, to avert the severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These 
      mitigation measures strike a balance between minimising COVID-19 associated 
      morbidity and fatalities and its adverse economic impact, and taken together have 
      significantly dampened the pandemic's impact on Kenya's populace.

TI  - Knowledge, practice and associated factors towards the prevention of COVID-19 among 
      high-risk groups: A cross-sectional study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
PG  - e0248420
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0248420 [doi]
LID - e0248420
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable virus that 
      continues to disrupt livelihoods, particularly those of low-income segments of 
      society, around the world. In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of 
      Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in 
      high-risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the 
      first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practice and associated 
      factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in 
      Addis Ababa. METHODS: A cross-sectional in person survey (n = 6007) was conducted 
      from 14-30 April, 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis 
      Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport 
      infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, 
      government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, 
      elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a 
      crowded areas. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, 
      practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes 
      (knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practice) were 
      measured using four items. A multi variable logistic regression was applied with 
      adjustment for potential confounding. RESULTS: About half (48%, 95% CI: 46-49) of 
      the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 
      whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58-61) had good knowledge on prevention methods 
      for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be 
      low (49%, 95% CI: 48-50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission 
      mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery 
      worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, 
      occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness 
      and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the 
      prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, 
      knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the 
      practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The study 
      highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and 
      prevention mechanisms. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that 
      contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority and high-risk 
      communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in 
      terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve prevention 
      practices and control the spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and 
      religious leaders could support the effort towards the increase in awareness.

AB  - In order to explore the rational use of nursing resources in the epidemic situation 
      of COVID-19, we optimized the shift arrangement in COVID-19 isolation area and 
      constructed a reasonable nursing schedule under the condition of limited human 
      resources. Seventy-eight nurses were arranged in COVID-19 isolation area to work for 
      1 week according to 3 different shifts: 4 + 4 h, 6 h and 6 h (overlapping by 1 h). 
      Through the form of questionnaire, the comprehensive job satisfaction of 3 different 
      models were compared, and the nursing quality and the consumption of protective 
      equipment under 3 different modes were analyzed. The results showed that the 
      comprehensive job satisfaction and nursing quality of nurses in 6 h (overlapping by 
      1 h) shift mode were better than those in other shift modes, and the consumption of 
      protective equipment was lower.

      COVID-19.
PG  - e24948
LID - 10.2196/24948 [doi]
LID - e24948
AB  - During disease outbreaks or pandemics, policy makers must convey information to the 
      public for informative purposes (eg, morbidity or mortality rates). They must also 
      motivate members of the public to cooperate with the guidelines, specifically by 
      changing their usual behavior. Policy makers have traditionally adopted a didactic 
      and formalistic stance by conveying dry, statistics-based health information to the 
      public. They have not yet considered the alternative of providing health information 
      in the form of narrative evidence, using stories that address both cognitive and 
      emotional aspects. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to introduce policy makers to 
      the advantages of using narrative evidence to provide health information during a 
      disease outbreak or pandemic such as COVID-19. Throughout human history, authorities 
      have tended to employ apocalyptic narratives during disease outbreaks or pandemics. 
      This viewpoint paper proposes an alternative coping narrative that includes the 
      following components: segmentation; barrier reduction; role models; empathy and 
      support; strengthening self-efficacy, community efficacy, and coping tools; 
      preventing stigmatization of at-risk populations; and communicating uncertainty. It 
      also discusses five conditions for using narrative evidence to produce an effective 
      communication campaign on social media: (1) identifying narratives that reveal the 
      needs, personal experiences, and questions of different subgroups to tailor 
      messaging to produce targeted behavioral change; (2) providing separate and distinct 
      treatment of each information unit or theory that arises on social networks; (3) 
      identifying positive deviants who found creative solutions for stress during the 
      COVID-19 crisis not found by other members of the community; (4) creating different 
      stories of coping; and (5) maintaining a dialogue with population subgroups (eg, 
      skeptical and hesitant groups). The paper concludes by proposing criteria for 
      evaluating the effectiveness of a narrative.

LID - 10.3390/pathogens10030256 [doi]
LID - 256
AB  - The spectrum of emerging new diseases as well as re-emerging old diseases is 
      broadening as infectious agents evolve, adapt, and spread at enormous speeds in 
      response to changing ecosystems. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) is a recent phenomenon and may take a while to understand its 
      transmission routes from less traveled territories, ranging from fomite exposure 
      routes to wastewater transmission. The critical challenge is how to negotiate with 
      such catastrophic pandemics in high-income countries (HICs ~20% of the global 
      population) and low-and middle-income countries (LMICs ~ 80% of the global 
      population) with a total global population size of approximately eight billion, 
      where practical mass testing and tracing is only a remote possibility, particularly 
      in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Keeping in mind the population 
      distribution disparities of high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs and urbanisation 
      trends over recent years, traditional wastewater-based surveillance such as that 
      used to combat polio may help in addressing this challenge. The COVID-19 era differs 
      from any previous pandemics or global health challenges in the sense that there is a 
      great deal of curiosity within the global community to find out everything about 
      this virus, ranging from diagnostics, potential vaccines/therapeutics, and possible 
      routes of transmission. In this regard, the fact that the gut is the common niche 
      for both poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2, and due to the shedding of the virus through 
      faecal material into sewerage systems, the need for long-term wastewater 
      surveillance and developing early warning systems for better preparedness at local 
      and global levels is increasingly apparent. This paper aims to provide an insight 
      into the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, how it can be managed, and what measures are 
      required to deal with a current global international public health concern. 
      Additionally, it shed light on the importance of using wastewater surveillance 
      strategy as an early warning practical tool suitable for massive passive screening, 
      as well as the urgent need for microfluidic technology as a rapid and cost-effective 
      approach tracking SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.

AB  - Papain-Like Protease (PLpro) is a key protein for SARS-CoV-2 viral replication which 
      is the cause of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. Targeting PLpro can suppress viral 
      replication and provide treatment options for COVID-19. Due to the dynamic nature of 
      its binding site loop, PLpro multiple conformations were generated through a 
      long-range 1 micro-second molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Clustering the MD 
      trajectory enabled us to extract representative structures for the conformational 
      space generated. Adding to the MD representative structures, X-ray structures were 
      involved in an ensemble docking approach to screen the FDA approved drugs for a drug 
      repositioning endeavor. Guided by our recent benchmarking study of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, 
      FRED docking software was selected for such a virtual screening task. The results 
      highlighted potential consensus binders to many of the MD clusters as well as the 
      newly introduced X-ray structure of PLpro complexed with a small molecule. For 
      instance, three drugs Benserazide, Dobutamine and Masoprocol showed a superior 
      consensus enrichment against the PLpro conformations. Further MD simulations for 
      these drugs complexed with PLpro suggested the superior stability and binding of 
      dobutamine and masoprocol inside the binding site compared to Benserazide. 
      Generally, this approach can facilitate identifying drugs for repositioning via 
      targeting multiple conformations of a crucial target for the rapidly emerging 
      COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic affecting 
      the global population. Community-based quarantine can slow down the pandemic growth 
      while adversely affecting population-wide psychological well-being. Affected 
      psychological well-being could potentially influence population compliance in 
      following stipulated community quarantine procedures. AIM: The aim was to quantify 
      psychological distress among Greater Jakarta area residents during the community 
      containment period. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to measure depression, anxiety, 
      and stress levels using the Indonesian version of the DASS-21. Demographic data on 
      sex, education strata, and working/productive-age group were also collected. 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional observational analytic study employed an online 
      questionnaire involving participants acquired through snowball sampling. The 
      questionnaire comprises two parts: demographic data and psychological distress 
      indicators. Linear regression evaluated psychological distress as a response 
      variable. RESULTS: Among 1,205 women and 824 men, our findings suggested male sex, 
      age in the range of 15-24 years, and having a bachelor's degree or professional 
      qualification have a strong association with psychological distress. CONCLUSION: By 
      addressing the population at risk, policymakers can identify better countermeasures 
      for preventing psychological distress.

TI  - The spatial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in China under the prevention and control 
      measures at the early outbreak.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 
      firstly reported in Wuhan City, China in December 2019, Novel Coronavirus Disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly spread from 
      person-to-person on worldwide scales. Now, COVID-19 is a non-traditional and major 
      public health issue the world is facing, and the outbreak is a global pandemic. The 
      strict prevention and control measures have mitigated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and 
      shown positive changes with important progress in China. But prevention and control 
      tasks remain arduous for the world. The objective of this study is to discuss the 
      difference of spatial transmission characteristics of COVID-19 in China at the early 
      outbreak stage with resolute efforts. Simultaneously, the COVID-19 trend of China at 
      the early time was described from the statistical perspective using a mathematical 
      model to evaluate the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures. METHODS: 
      In this study, the accumulated number of confirmed cases publicly reported by the 
      National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (CNHC) from January 20 
      to February 11, 2020, were grouped into three partly overlapping regions: Chinese 
      mainland including Hubei province, Hubei province alone, and the other 30 
      provincial-level regions on Chinese mainland excluding Hubei province, respectively. 
      A generalized-growth model (GGM) was used to estimate the basic reproduction number 
      to evaluate the transmissibility in different spatial locations. The prevention and 
      control of COVID-19 in the early stage were analyzed based on the number of new 
      cases of confirmed infections daily reported. RESULTS: Results indicated that the 
      accumulated number of confirmed cases reported from January 20 to February 11, 2020, 
      is well described by the GGM model with a larger correlation coefficient than 0.99. 
      When the accumulated number of confirmed cases is well fitted by an exponential 
      function, the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 of the 31 provincial-level 
      regions on the Chinese mainland, Hubei province, and the other 30 provincial-level 
      regions on the Chinese mainland excluding Hubei province, is 2.68, 6.46 and 2.18, 
      respectively. The consecutive decline of the new confirmed cases indicated that the 
      prevention and control measures taken by the Chinese government have contained the 
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a short period. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated basic 
      reproduction number thorough GGM model can reflect the spatial difference of 
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission in China at the early stage. The strict prevention and 
      control measures of SARS-CoV-2 taken at the early outbreak can effectively reduce 
      the new confirmed cases outside Hubei and have mitigated the spread and yielded 
      positive results since February 2, 2020. The research results indicated that the 
      outbreak of COVID-19 in China was sustaining localized at the early outbreak stage 
      and has been gradually curbed by China's resolute efforts.

AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the 
      pathogen responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has devastated public 
      health services and economies worldwide. Despite global efforts to contain the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now found in over 200 countries and has caused an 
      upward death toll of over 1 million human lives as of November 2020. To date, only 
      one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic drug (Remdesivir) and a 
      monoclonal antibody, MAb (Bamlanivimab) are available for the treatment of 
      SARS-CoV-2. As with other viruses, studying SARS-CoV-2 requires the use of secondary 
      approaches to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells. To overcome this 
      limitation, we have generated replication-competent recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 
      expressing fluorescent (Venus or mCherry) or bioluminescent (Nluc) reporter genes. 
      Vero E6 cells infected with reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be easily detected 
      via fluorescence or luciferase expression and display a good correlation between 
      reporter gene expression and viral replication. Moreover, rSARS-CoV-2 expressing 
      reporter genes have comparable plaque sizes and growth kinetics to those of 
      wild-type virus, rSARS-CoV-2/WT. We used these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 to 
      demonstrate their feasibility to identify neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or 
      antiviral drugs. Our results demonstrate that reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 
      represent an excellent option to identify therapeutics for the treatment of 
      SARS-CoV-2, where reporter gene expression can be used as valid surrogates to track 
      viral infection. Moreover, the ability to manipulate the viral genome opens the 
      feasibility of generating viruses expressing foreign genes for their use as vaccines 
      for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19), has significantly impacted the human health and economic status 
      worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify effective prophylactics and 
      therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 
      disease. The use of fluorescent- or luciferase-expressing reporter expressing 
      viruses has significantly advanced viral research. Here, we generated recombinant 
      (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus and mCherry) or luciferase (Nluc) 
      reporter genes and demonstrate that they represent an excellent option to track 
      viral infections in vitro. Importantly, reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 display 
      similar growth kinetics and plaque phenotype that their wild-type counterpart 
      (rSARS-CoV-2/WT), demonstrating their feasibility to identify drugs and/or 
      neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) for the therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2. 
      Henceforth, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be used to interrogate large 
      libraries of compounds and/or monoclonal antibodies (MAb), in high-throughput 
      screening settings, to identify those with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: two months into the COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon, we assess the trend 
      in the knowledge, attitude and practices of the population with the progression of 
      the disease and the implementation of preventive methods put in place by the 
      government of Cameroon and health partners organizations in response to the 
      pandemic. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study conducted in selected health 
      areas in the Buea municipality. A questionnaire was administered at the onset and 
      two months later to collect data on the participants´ knowledge, attitude and 
      practices towards COVID-19. The data were analyzed in SPSS version 25. RESULTS: a 
      total of 480 and 680 participants were sampled at onset and two months later 
      respectively. Of the 26 indicators of knowledge assessed, 22 (84.61%) showed 
      significant increase (p&lt;0.05) with the most significant changes observed with the 
      symptoms, mode of transmission and prevention of the disease. The overall proportion 
      of people with correct knowledge moved from 9.1% at onset to 41.4% two months after. 
      Only 1.5% of participants had poor knowledge of the pandemic two months after 
      against 14.2% at the onset. There was a significant (p&lt;0.05) positive change in the 
      population perception, attitude and practices toward COVID-19 two months after the 
      onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: the population knowledge, attitude and practices 
      on COVID-19 showed a positive trend two months after the onset of the pandemic. The 
      implementation of government and health stakeholder preventive measures together 
      with the incidence of the pandemic in Cameroon probably had a positive impact on the 
      positive trend observed. There is a need for continuous sensitization to completely 
      fill the knowledge gap of the population on COVID-19.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the largest health crisis ever 
      faced worldwide. It has resulted in great health and economic costs because no 
      effective treatment is currently available. Since infected persons vary in 
      presentation from healthy asymptomatic mild symptoms to those who need intensive 
      care support and eventually succumb to the disease, this illness is considered to 
      depend primarily on individual immunity. Demographic distribution and disease 
      severity in several regions of the world vary; therefore, it is believed that 
      natural inherent immunity provided through dietary sources and traditional medicines 
      could play an important role in infection prevention and disease progression. People 
      can boost their immunity to prevent them from infection after COVID-19 exposure and 
      can reduce their inflammatory reactions to protect their organ deterioration in case 
      suffering from the disease. Some drugs with in-situ immunomodulatory and 
      anti-inflammatory activity are also identified as adjunctive therapy in the COVID-19 
      era. This review discusses the importance of COVID-19 interactions with immune cells 
      and inflammatory cells; and further emphasizes the possible pathways related with 
      traditional herbs, medications and nutritional products. We believe that such 
      pathophysiological pathway approach treatment is rational and important for future 
      development of new therapeutic agents for prevention or cure of COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Humans have witnessed three deadly pandemics so far in the twenty-first century 
      which are associated with novel coronaviruses: SARS, Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19. All of these viruses, which are responsible for 
      causing acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), are highly contagious in nature 
      and/or have caused high mortalities. The recently emerged COVID-19 disease is a 
      highly transmittable viral infection caused by another zoonotic novel coronavirus 
      named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Similar to the 
      other two coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also likely 
      to have originated from bats, which have been serving as established reservoirs for 
      various pathogenic coronaviruses. Although, it is still unknown how SARS-CoV-2 is 
      transmitted from bats to humans, the rapid human-to-human transmission has been 
      confirmed widely. The disease first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and 
      quickly spread across the globe, infected 48,539,872 people, and caused 1,232,791 
      deaths in 215 countries, and the infection is still spreading at the time of 
      manuscript preparation. So far, there is no definite line of treatment which has 
      been approved or vaccine which is available. However, different types of potential 
      vaccines and therapeutics have been evaluated and/or are under clinical trials 
      against COVID-19. In this review, we summarize different types of acute respiratory 
      diseases and briefly discuss earlier outbreaks of coronaviruses and compare their 
      occurrence and pathogenicity with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Various 
      epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 such as mode of spread, death rate, doubling 
      time, etc., have been discussed in detail. Apart from this, different technical 
      issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic including use of masks and other 
      socio-economic problems associated with the pandemic have also been summarized. 
      Additionally, we have reviewed various aspects of patient management strategies 
      including mechanism of action, available diagnostic tools, etc., and also discussed 
      different strategies for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutic 
      combinations to deal with this viral outbreak. Overall, by the inclusion of various 
      references, this review covers, in detail, the most important aspects of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Born in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the consequences of the coronavirus 
      pandemic on global health and economies have been and continue to be devastating. In 
      Africa, its countries grieve for unprecedented burdens of caseloads and mortality 
      due to COVID-19, the virus responsible for the disease. This narrative review aims 
      to establish the scale of the health and economic crisis wrought by the pandemic in 
      Africa, including its impact on the informal economic sector, projections of the 
      effect on national GDP, as well as its political dimensions. METHODS: Documentary 
      evidence issued between January and 8 August 2020 was sought from the Google 
      Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Searches of published and 
      unpublished abstracts were also conducted from appropriate websites, government 
      documents, organizational reports, newspaper commentaries, and reports issued by 
      global, regional, and local centers of disease control and prevention. RESULTS: The 
      COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for a fourfold crisis in Africa: (1) a health 
      crisis: the victimization of frontline healthcare workers and the looming caseload 
      and death tolls with 1.039 million (12%) cases being confirmed and over 22,966 
      (2.4%) deaths as of 8 August 2020. The highest death toll was recorded in Southern 
      Africa of 11,024 (48%) followed by North Africa with 6,989 (29.2%) deaths; (2) a 
      social crisis: with the violation of human rights, the killing of citizens by 
      security forces and increased crime. This, in turn, exacerbates social inequalities, 
      the breakdown of households, instances of social unrest, and general impoverishment; 
      (3) an economic crisis: manifested by a decline in GDP and mass unemployment; (4) a 
      political crisis: implementation of measures that may not be appropriate for Africa, 
      discrimination of refugees and immigrants, evacuation of citizens to their home 
      countries, resulting in distrust of political leaders and postponement of national 
      elections, and mounting cases of conflicts and unrest. CONCLUSION: Lockdown during 
      the COVID-19 outbreak is a prevention mechanism in affluent countries, in contrast 
      to developing regions such as Africa, where it is a race against death and 
      starvation. Policymakers must apply novel and locally relevant prevention and 
      management strategies to cope with this growing disaster.

LID - 10.15537/smj.2020.12.25514 [doi]
AB  - To analyze the clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes among coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive medical staff compared with those of 
      public. Methods: A total of 108 COVID-19-positive medical staff patients were 
      included in the study from March 23, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Patients were analyzed 
      for demographic data, clinical presentations, and in-hospital outcomes and compared 
      against 661 COVID-19-infected patients of non-medical personel. Results: Mean age of 
      medical staff patients was 44.05±13.9 years, most of whom were women (63.9%). The 
      infected medical staff members consisted of 63 nurses (58.3%), 37 physicians 
      (34.3%), 5 technicians (4.6%), and 3 pharmacists (2.8%). Smoking (60.2%) was 
      the most frequent, followed by diabetes mellitus (37%). Of 108 COVID-19 infected 
      medical staff, 18 (16.6%) were isolated in the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 
      14 (77.8%) were male, 16 (88.9%) were smokers, and 16 (88.9%) presented with 
      pneumonia. Fatality ratio among medical staff patients was 4.6%. Male gender with 
      odds ratios (OR) of 7.771 and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 0.837-72.195 and a 
      history of chronic kidney disease of (OR=10.778, 95% CI: 1.503-77.287) were 
      predictors of death among the medical staff group. Conclusion: The incidence of 
      COVID-19 infection among medical staff is quite high, but the occurrence of extreme 
      illness and death is significantly low compared with the general community. Training 
      should be implemented for all hospital staff on infection prevention techniques. 
      Reliable and quick access for testing medical personnel is essential to maintain 
      health, safety, and availability of health care workers during this pandemic.

TI  - Dental and Medical Students' Knowledge and Attitude toward COVID-19: A 
      Cross-Sectional Study from Pakistan.
PG  - S97-S104
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1719219 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE:  The aims of this study were to investigate the awareness, knowledge, and 
      attitudes of Pakistani medical and dental undergraduate students toward COVID-19 
      during the surge of its outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The multicentered, 
      cross-sectional study was carried out nationwide among undergraduate medical and 
      dental students. A convenience sampling technique was used. A self-developed online 
      questionnaire was pretested to be completed by the participants. It was distributed 
      using social media. The survey was comprised of questions related to demographics, 
      health status, general hygiene perception, understanding, and the learning attitudes 
      of the students. Comparisons of the knowledge scores and the attitude responses with 
      the demographic information were done using the independent t-test, one-way ANOVA, 
      and Chi-square, as appropriate. RESULTS:  Of the 937 total respondents, 353 (38%) 
      were males and 582 (62%) were females; two students did not mark their gender. Of 
      these, 680 (73%) were dental students and 257 (27%) were medical students. The mean 
      knowledge score of the female dental students (5.15 ± 1.08) was significantly higher 
      than that of the male students (4.87 ± 1.09). Overall, the mean knowledge score was 
      statistically higher among the medical students in comparison to the dental students 
      (5.21 ± 1.15, 5.05 ± 1.09; p = 0.054), respectively. CONCLUSION:  The medical and 
      dental students were both aware of the importance of the use of a mask. The medical 
      students had a greater awareness regarding the mode of transmission, symptoms, and 
      origin of COVID-19. However, the dental students showed better understanding of the 
      use of surgical masks and the correct protocol for hand washing. Social media was 
      considered the main source for COVID-19 related information.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a rapidly growing pandemic caused by the 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its papain-like 
      protease (SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) is a crucial target to halt virus replication. SARS-CoV 
      PLpro and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro share an 82.9% sequence identity and a 100% sequence 
      identity for the binding site reported to accommodate small molecules in SARS-CoV. 
      The flexible key binding site residues Tyr269 and Gln270 for small-molecule 
      recognition in SARS-CoV PLpro exist also in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. This inspired us to 
      use the reported small-molecule binders to SARS-CoV PLpro to generate a high-quality 
      DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set. Accordingly, we used them in a cross-benchmarking study 
      against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. As there is no SARS-CoV-2 PLpro structure complexed with a 
      small-molecule ligand publicly available at the time of manuscript submission, we 
      built a homology model based on the ligand-bound SARS-CoV structure for benchmarking 
      and docking purposes. Three publicly available docking tools FRED, AutoDock Vina, 
      and PLANTS were benchmarked. All showed better-than-random performances, with FRED 
      performing best against the built model. Detailed performance analysis via 
      pROC-Chemotype plots showed a strong enrichment of the most potent bioactives in the 
      early docking ranks. Cross-benchmarking against the X-ray structure complexed with a 
      peptide-like inhibitor confirmed that FRED is the best-performing tool. Furthermore, 
      we performed cross-benchmarking against the newly introduced X-ray structure 
      complexed with a small-molecule ligand. Interestingly, its benchmarking profile and 
      chemotype enrichment were comparable to the built model. Accordingly, we used FRED 
      in a prospective virtual screen of the DrugBank database. In conclusion, this study 
      provides an example of how to harness a custom-made DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set as an 
      approach to enhance the virtual screening success rate against a vital target of the 
      rapidly emerging pandemic.

AB  - Prevention of exposure to the COVID-19 virus in the general population is an 
      essential strategy to slow community transmission. This paper shares the experiences 
      and challenges of community engagement in COVID-19 prevention in the Kilimanjaro 
      region, Northern Tanzania implemented by our team from the Institute of Public 
      Health (IPH), Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College (KCMUCo) in 
      collaboration with the COVID-19 response team in the Moshi Municipality. We 
      conducted an education session with the COVID-19 response team and together 
      brainstormed transmission hotspots and which interventions would be most feasible in 
      their settings. The first hotspot identified was crowded local market spaces. 
      Suggested interventions included targeted and mass public health education through 
      the engagement of market opinion leaders, public announcements, and radio shows. We 
      conducted participatory rural appraisal techniques to enable market vendors and 
      clients to visualize two-meter distances and provided a prototype hand-washing 
      facility that was foot operated. We found mass public health educational campaigns 
      essential to inform and update the public about COVID-19 pandemic and to address 
      rumors and misinformation, which hampers compliance with public health 
      interventions. Coordinated efforts among stakeholders in the country are necessary 
      to develop context-specific prevention and case management strategies following the 
      national and international guidelines. Local ownership of recommended interventions 
      is necessary to ensure compliance.

TI  - Factors affecting the mortality of patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery and the 
      safety of medical staff: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 100612
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100612 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can complicate the 
      perioperative course to increase postoperative mortality in operative patients, and 
      also is a serious threat to medical staff. However, studies summarizing the impact 
      of COVID-19 on the perioperative mortality of patients and on the safety of medical 
      staff are lacking. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Chinese 
      database National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) with the search terms "COVID-19″ 
      or "SARS-CoV-2″ and "Surgery" or "Operation" for all published articles on COVID-19 
      from December 1, 2019 to October 5, 2020. FINDINGS: A total of 269 patients from 47 
      studies were included in our meta-analysis. The mean age of operative patients with 
      COVID-19 was 50.91 years, and 49% were female. A total of 28 patients were deceased, 
      with the overall mortality of 6%. All deceased patients had postoperative 
      complications associated with operation or COVID-19, including respiratory failure, 
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), short of breath, dyspnea, fever, cough, 
      fatigue or myalgia, cardiopulmonary system, shock/infection, acute kidney injury and 
      severe lymphopenia. Patients who presented any or more of the symptoms of 
      respiratory failure, ARDS, short of breath and dyspnea after operation were 
      associated with significantly higher mortality (r = 0.891, p &lt; 0.001), while 
      patients whose symptoms were presented as fever, cough, fatigue or myalgia only 
      demonstrated marginally significant association with postoperative mortality 
      (r = 0.675, p = 0.023). Twenty studies reported the information of medical staff 
      infection, and a total of 38 medical staff were infected, and medical staff who used 
      biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) protective equipment did not get infected. INTERPRETATION: 
      COVID-19 patients, in particular those with severe respiratory complications, may 
      have high postoperative mortality. Medical staff in close contact with infected 
      patients is suggested to take high level personal protective equipment (PPE).

TI  - The Double Burden of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Polypharmacy on Geriatric Population 
      - Public Health Implications.
PG  - 1007-1022
LID - 10.2147/TCRM.S272908 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic is inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ 
      failure, and eventual death. Respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality 
      in the elderly population with pre-existing medical conditions. This group is 
      particularly vulnerable to infections due to a declined immune system, 
      comorbidities, geriatric syndrome, and potentially inappropriate polypharmacy. These 
      conditions make the elderly population more susceptible to the harmful effects of 
      medications and the deleterious consequences of infections, including MERS-CoV, 
      SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Chronic diseases among elderlies, including respiratory 
      diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart diseases, present a significant 
      challenge for healthcare professionals. To comply with the clinical guidelines, the 
      practitioner may prescribe a complex medication regimen that adds up to the burden 
      of pre-existing treatment, potentially inducing adverse drug reactions and leading 
      to harmful side-effects. Consequently, the geriatric population is at increased risk 
      of falls, frailty, and dependence that enhances their susceptibility to morbidity 
      and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 respiratory syndrome, particularly interstitial 
      pneumonia. The major challenge resides in the detection of infection that may 
      present as atypical manifestations in this age group. Healthy aging can be possible 
      with adequate preventive measures and appropriate medication regimen and follow-up. 
      Adherence to the guidelines and recommendations of WHO, CDC, and other 
      national/regional/international agencies can reduce the risks of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Better training programs are needed to enhance the skill of health care 
      professionals and patient's caregivers. This review explains the public health 
      implications associated with polypharmacy on the geriatric population with 
      pre-existing co-morbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Strategies to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections: A Narrative Overview.
PG  - 1765-1780
LID - 10.2147/RMHP.S269315 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are a major source of morbidity and 
      mortality and are the second most prevalent cause of death. Furthermore, it has been 
      reported that for every one-hundred patients admitted to hospital, seven patients in 
      high-income economies and ten in emerging and low-income economies acquire at least 
      one type of HCAI. Currently, almost all pathogenic microorganisms have developed 
      antimicrobial resistance, and few new antimicrobials are being developed and brought 
      to market. The literature search for this narrative review was performed by 
      searching bibliographic databases (including Google Scholar and PubMed) using the 
      search terms: "Strategies," "Prevention," and "Healthcare-Associated Infections," 
      followed by snowballing references cited by critical articles. We found that 
      although hand hygiene is a centuries-old concept, it is still the primary strategy 
      used around the world to prevent HCAIs. It forms one of a bundle of approaches used 
      to clean and maintain a safe hospital environment and to stop the transmission of 
      contagious and infectious microorganisms, including multidrug-resistant microbes. 
      Finally, antibiotic stewardship also has a crucial role in reducing the impact of 
      HCAIs through conserving currently available antimicrobials.

TI  - Delivering Cancer Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Recommendations and Lessons 
      Learned From ASCO Global Webinars.
PG  - 1461-1471
LID - 10.1200/GO.20.00423 [doi]
LID - GO.20.00423
AB  - PURPOSE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ASCO launched a Global Webinar 
      Series to address various aspects of cancer care during the pandemic. Here we 
      present the lessons learned and recommendations that have emerged from these 
      webinars. METHODS: Fifteen international health care experts from different global 
      regions and oncology disciplines participated in one of the six 1-hour webinars to 
      discuss the latest data, share their experiences, and provide recommendations to 
      manage cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions include didactic 
      presentations followed by a moderated discussion and questions from the audience. 
      All recommendations have been transcribed, categorized, and reviewed by the experts, 
      who have also approved the consensus recommendations. RESULTS: The summary 
      recommendations are divided into different categories, including risk minimization; 
      care prioritization of patients; health care team management; virtual care; 
      management of patients with cancer undergoing surgical, radiation, and systemic 
      therapy; clinical research; and recovery plans. The recommendations emphasize the 
      protection of patients and health care teams from infections, delivery of timely and 
      appropriate care, reduction of harm from the interruption of care, and preparation 
      to handle a surge of new COVID-19 cases, complications, or comorbidities thereof. 
      CONCLUSION: The recommendations from the ASCO Global Webinar Series may guide 
      practicing oncologists to manage their patients during the ongoing pandemic and help 
      organizations recover from the crisis. Implementation of these recommendations may 
      improve understanding of how COVID-19 has affected cancer care and increase 
      readiness to manage the current and any future outbreaks effectively.

AB  - PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic affected health care systems globally and resulted in 
      the interruption of usual care in many health care facilities, exposing vulnerable 
      patients with cancer to significant risks. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of 
      this pandemic on cancer care worldwide. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional 
      study using a validated web-based questionnaire of 51 items. The questionnaire 
      obtained information on the capacity and services offered at these centers, 
      magnitude of disruption of care, reasons for disruption, challenges faced, 
      interventions implemented, and the estimation of patient harm during the pandemic. 
      RESULTS: A total of 356 centers from 54 countries across six continents participated 
      between April 21 and May 8, 2020. These centers serve 716,979 new patients with 
      cancer a year. Most of them (88.2%) reported facing challenges in delivering care 
      during the pandemic. Although 55.34% reduced services as part of a preemptive 
      strategy, other common reasons included an overwhelmed system (19.94%), lack of 
      personal protective equipment (19.10%), staff shortage (17.98%), and restricted 
      access to medications (9.83%). Missing at least one cycle of therapy by &gt; 10% of 
      patients was reported in 46.31% of the centers. Participants reported patient 
      exposure to harm from interruption of cancer-specific care (36.52%) and 
      noncancer-related care (39.04%), with some centers estimating that up to 80% of 
      their patients were exposed to harm. CONCLUSION: The detrimental impact of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care is widespread, with varying magnitude among centers 
      worldwide. Additional research to assess this impact at the patient level is 
      required.

AB  - Infectious coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in the city of Wuhan 
      (China) in December 2019, causing a pandemic that has dramatically impacted public 
      health and socioeconomic activities worldwide. A previously unknown coronavirus, 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified as the 
      causative agent of COVID-19. To date, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA)-approved vaccines or therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or associated COVID-19 disease, which has triggered a large 
      influx of scientific efforts to develop countermeasures to control SARS-CoV-2 
      spread. To contribute to these efforts, we have developed an infectious cDNA clone 
      of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain based on the use of a bacterial artificial 
      chromosome (BAC). Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) was readily rescued by 
      transfection of the BAC into Vero E6 cells. Importantly, BAC-derived rSARS-CoV-2 
      exhibited growth properties and plaque sizes in cultured cells comparable to those 
      of the natural SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Likewise, rSARS-CoV-2 showed levels of 
      replication similar to those of the natural isolate in nasal turbinates and lungs of 
      infected golden Syrian hamsters. This is, to our knowledge, the first BAC-based 
      reverse genetics system for the generation of infectious rSARS-CoV-2 that displays 
      features in vivo similar to those of a natural viral isolate. This SARS-CoV-2 
      BAC-based reverse genetics will facilitate studies addressing several important 
      questions in the biology of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the identification of antivirals 
      and development of vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated 
      COVID-19 disease.IMPORTANCE The pandemic coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major threat to 
      global human health. To date, there are no approved prophylactics or therapeutics 
      available for COVID-19. Reverse genetics is a powerful approach to understand 
      factors involved in viral pathogenesis, antiviral screening, and vaccine 
      development. In this study, we describe the feasibility of generating recombinant 
      SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) by transfection of a single bacterial artificial chromosome 
      (BAC). Importantly, rSARS-CoV-2 possesses the same phenotype as the natural isolate 
      in vitro and in vivo This is the first description of a BAC-based reverse genetics 
      system for SARS-CoV-2 and the first time that an rSARS-CoV-2 isolate has been shown 
      to be phenotypically identical to a natural isolate in a validated animal model of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. The BAC-based reverse genetics approach will facilitate the 
      study of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of prophylactics and therapeutics for the 
      treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Evaluation of Remote Pharmacist-Led Outpatient Service for Geriatric Patients on 
      Rivaroxaban for Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 1275

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of remote medication 
      management of rivaroxaban by pharmacists for geriatric patients with nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A single-site, 
      prospective cohort study was conducted among patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation who received rivaroxaban therapy from July 2019 to December 2019. 
      Patients in the pharmacist-led education and follow-up service (PEFS) group were 
      managed remotely by a pharmacist. In contrast, those in the usual care (UC) group 
      were managed by other providers. Data of routine blood tests, coagulation function 
      tests, which also included cardiac function parameters were collected. The number 
      and type of provider encounters, interventions related to rivaroxaban therapy, the 
      occurrence of thromboembolism or bleeding, and the time of the first outpatient 
      visit after discharge were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 600 patients were 
      recruited, and results of 381 patients were analyzed in the end, of which 179 
      patients were from the PEFS group and 202 were from the UC group. There was no 
      significant difference between the two groups in terms of the occurrence ratio of 
      systemic thrombosis, heart failure (LVEF &lt; 40%), and left atrial dilation, which was 
      defined as enlargement of left atrial diameter (LAD) &gt; 40 mm. The cumulative 
      incidences of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal tract and skin 
      ecchymosis, were significantly higher in the UC group (12.4% vs. 6.1%, P=0.038; 4.5% 
      vs. 0.6%, P=0.018). There was no significant difference after pharmacist 
      intervention in terms of thrombosis occurrence ratio between the two groups (P = 
      0.338, HR: 0.722, 95% CI: 0.372-1.405). Remote instruction by a pharmacist reduced 
      outpatient service frequency within the first 30 days after discharge (23.7% vs. 
      1.1%, P &lt; 0.001). However, more patients in the PEFS group presented for the first 
      outpatient revisit later than 40 days post-discharge (12.8% vs. 21.3%, P &lt; 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: Remote pharmacist-led medication instruction of rivaroxaban could reduce 
      bleeding complications of the gastrointestinal tract and skin ecchymosis and 
      postpone the first outpatient revisit after discharge.

AB  - Many articles have been written in the medical field related to the Covid-19 
      outbreak that has surrounded the World and killed many people. However, its 
      environmental and energy impacts have not been sufficiently studied. Some sources 
      argue that Covid-19 outbreak reduces pollution environmentally, while others say 
      that environmentally significant damages await us. On the other hand, it is wondered 
      how the global flexible renewable energy sector will react to Covid-19 outbreak. In 
      this study, the effects of Covid-19 outbreak in terms of the environment and 
      renewable energy sector in the literature were examined in detail and the findings 
      obtained were discussed. The main aim of this study is to shed light on the future 
      studies of environmental and renewable energy researchers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emerging infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a 
      serious threat in China and worldwide. Challenged by this serious situation, China 
      has taken many measures to contain its transmission. This study aims to 
      systematically review and record these special and effective practices, in hope of 
      benefiting for fighting against the ongoing worldwide pandemic. METHODS: The 
      measures taken by the governments was tracked and sorted on a daily basis from the 
      websites of governmental authorities (e.g. National Health Commission of the 
      People's Republic of China). And the measures were reviewed and summarized by 
      categorizations, figures and tables, showing an ever-changing process of combating 
      with an emerging infectious disease. The population shift levels, daily local new 
      diagnosed cases, daily mortality and daily local new cured cases were used for 
      measuring the effect of the measures. RESULTS: The practices could be categorized 
      into active case surveillance, rapid case diagnosis and management, strict follow-up 
      and quarantine of persons with close contacts, and issuance of guidance to help the 
      public understand and adhere to control measures, plus prompt and effective 
      high-level policy decision, complete activation of the public health system, and 
      full involvement of the society. Along with the measures, the population shift 
      levels, daily local new diagnosed cases, and mortality were decreased, and the daily 
      local new cured cases were increased in China. CONCLUSIONS: China's practices are 
      effective in controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Considering newly occurred 
      situations (e.g. imported cases, work resumption), the control measures may be 
      adjusted.

AB  - The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is of global health concern. It 
      is a serious public health emergency for the entire world, threatening human life 
      and public health security. To address the epidemic, it is necessary not only to 
      take good prevention and treatment measures, but also to have effective and targeted 
      public health emergency governance. That said, reports focusing on governance are 
      scant. In this commentary, we summarize China's model to combat the COVID-19 
      epidemic from a public health emergency governance approach. Stemmed from goals and 
      values, a number of mechanisms are put forward, which include: a whole-of-government 
      response and accountability, setting up a multi-sectoral cooperation platform, 
      swiftly scaling up epidemic emergency capacity, whole-of-society actions with 
      engagement of social organizations, and engaging citizens in the epidemic prevention 
      and control. As the epidemic continues to evolve, other countries might learn from 
      China to build their own, context-specific models for better outcomes.

TI  - How Shenzhen, China avoided widespread community transmission: a potential model for 
      successful prevention and control of COVID-19.

AB  - Shenzhen is a city of 22 million people in south China that serves as a financial 
      and trade center for East Asia. The city has extensive ties to Hubei Province, the 
      first reported epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the 
      world. Initial predictions suggested Shenzhen would experience a high number of 
      COVID-19 cases. These predictions have not materialized. As of 31 March 
      2020 Shenzhen had only 451 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Contact tracing has shown 
      that no cases were the result of community transmission within the city. While 
      Shenzhen did not implement a citywide lockdown like Wuhan, it did put into place a 
      rapid response system first developed after the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS) epidemic in 2003. In the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak, Shenzhen health 
      authority created a network for surveillance and responding to novel respiratory 
      infections, including pneumonia of unknown causes (PUC). The network rapidly 
      detected mass discussion about PUC and immediately deployed emergency preparedness, 
      quarantine for close contacts of PUC. Five early actions (early detection, early 
      reporting, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment) and four 
      centralized responses (centralized coordination by experts, centralized allocation 
      of resources, centralized placement of patients, and centralized provision of 
      treatment) ensured effective prevention and control. Tripartite working teams 
      comprising community cadres, medical personnel and police were formulated to conduct 
      contact tracing at each neighborhood and residential community. Incorporation of 
      mobile technology, big data, and artificial intelligence into COVID-19 response 
      increased accessibility to health services, reduced misinformation and minimized the 
      impact of fake news. Shenzhen's unique experience in successfully controlling the 
      COVID-19 outbreak may be a useful model for countries and regions currently 
      experiencing rapid spread of the virus.

TI  - Epidemic and pandemic viral infections: impact on tuberculosis and the lung: A 
      consensus by the World Association for Infectious Diseases and Immunological

      Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Study Group for 
      Mycobacterial Infections (ESGMYC).

AB  - Major epidemics, including some that qualify as pandemics, such as severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV, influenza 
      A (H1N1)pdm/09 and most recently COVID-19, affect the lung. Tuberculosis (TB) 
      remains the top infectious disease killer, but apart from syndemic TB/HIV little is 
      known regarding the interaction of viral epidemics and pandemics with TB. The aim of 
      this consensus-based document is to describe the effects of viral infections 
      resulting in epidemics and pandemics that affect the lung (MERS, SARS, HIV, 
      influenza A (H1N1)pdm/09 and COVID-19) and their interactions with TB. A search of 
      the scientific literature was performed. A writing committee of international 
      experts including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Public 
      Health Emergency (ECDC PHE) team, the World Association for Infectious Diseases and 
      Immunological Disorders (WAidid), the Global Tuberculosis Network (GTN), and members 
      of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) 
      Study Group for Mycobacterial Infections (ESGMYC) was established. Consensus was 
      achieved after multiple rounds of revisions between the writing committee and a 
      larger expert group. A Delphi process involving the core group of authors (excluding 
      the ECDC PHE team) identified the areas requiring review/consensus, followed by a 
      second round to refine the definitive consensus elements. The epidemiology and 
      immunology of these viral infections and their interactions with TB are discussed 
      with implications for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of airborne infections 
      (infection control, viral containment and workplace safety). This consensus document 
      represents a rapid and comprehensive summary on what is known on the topic.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection caused by Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 significantly affects 
      multiple systems including the cardiovascular system. Most importantly, in addition 
      to the direct injury from the virus per se, the subsequent cytokine storm, an 
      overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds, causes devastating 
      damage. To date, emerging anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments are warranted to control 
      epidemics. Several candidate drugs have been screened and are currently under 
      investigation. These primarily include antiviral regimens and immunomodulatory 
      regimens. However, beyond the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, these drugs may also have 
      risks to the cardiovascular system, especially altering cardiac conduction. Herein, 
      we review the cardiovascular risks of potential anti-COVID-19 drugs.

TI  - The Urban-Rural Disparity in the Status and Risk Factors of Health Literacy: A 
      Cross-Sectional Survey in Central China.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17113848 [doi]
LID - 3848
AB  - Health literacy is the ability of individuals to access, process, and understand 
      health information to make decisions regarding treatment and their health on the 
      whole; it is critical to maintain and improve public health. However, the health 
      literacy of urban and rural populations in China has been little known. Thus, this 
      study aims to assess the status of health literacy and explore the differences of 
      its possible determinants (e.g., socio-economic factors) among urban and rural 
      populations in Henan, China. A cross-sectional study, 78,646 participants were 
      recruited from a populous province in central China with a multi-stage random 
      sampling design. The Chinese Resident Health Literacy Scale was adopted to measure 
      the health literacy of the respondents. In the participants, the level of health 
      literacy (10.21%) in central China was significantly lower than the national 
      average, and a big gap was identified between urban and rural populations (16.92% 
      vs. 8.09%). A noticeable difference was reported in different aspects and health 
      issues of health literacy between urban and rural populations. The health literacy 
      level was lower in those with lower levels of education, and a significant 
      difference was identified in the level of health literacy among people of different 
      ages and occupations in both urban and rural areas. Note that in rural areas, as 
      long as residents educated, they all had higher odds to exhibit basic health 
      literacy than those uneducated; in rural areas, compared with those aged 15 to 24 
      years, residents aged 45 to 54 years (OR = 0.846,95% CI (0.730, 0.981)), 55 to 64 
      years (OR = 0.716,95% CI (0.614, 0.836)) and above 65 years (OR = 0.679, 95% CI 
      (0.567, 0.812)) were 84.6%, 71.6%, and 67.9%, respectively, less likely to exhibit 
      basic health literacy. Considering the lower health literacy among rural residents 
      compared with their urban counterparts, a reorientation of the health policy-making 
      for Chinese rural areas is recommended. This study suggests that urban-rural 
      disparity about health literacy risk factors should be considered when implementing 
      health literacy promotion intervention.
