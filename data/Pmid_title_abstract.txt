Biallelic mutations of EGFR in a compound heterozygous state cause ectodermal dysplasia with severe skin defects and gastrointestinal dysfunction
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor that recognizes epidermal growth factor, is a very important regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. To date, three cases of severe ectodermal dysplasia were reported to be caused by an inherited germline homozygous loss-of-function missense mutation of EGFR. This is the first report of a patient with biallelic compound heterozygous mutations in EGFR.

Germline EGFR variants are over-represented in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with adrenocortical carcinoma
Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine tumor with poor overall prognosis and 1.5-fold overrepresentation in females. In children, ACC is associated with inherited cancer syndromes with 50-80% of childhood-ACC associated with TP53 germline variants. ACC in adolescents and young adults (AYA) is rarely due to germline TP53, IGF2, PRKAR1A and MEN1 variants. We analyzed exome sequencing data from 21 children (<15y), 32 AYA (15-39y), and 60 adults (>39y) with ACC, and retained all pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and highly prioritized variants of uncertain significance. We engineered a stable lentiviral-mutant ACC cell line, harboring an EGFR variant (p.Asp1080Asn) from a 21-year-old female without germline-TP53-variant and with aggressive ACC. We found that 4.8% of the children (P = 0.004) and 6.2% of AYA (P < 0.0001), all-female participants, harbored germline EGFR variants, compared to only 0.3% of the control group. Expanding our analysis to the RTK-RAS-MAPK pathway, we found that the RTK genes have the highest number of highly prioritized germline variants in these individuals amongst all three arms of this pathway. We showed EGFR mutant cells migrate faster and are characterized by a stem-like phenotype compared to wild type cells. While EGFR inhibitors did not affect the stemness of mutant cells, Sunitinib, a multireceptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced their stem-like behavior. Our data suggest that EGFR could be a novel underlying germline predisposition factor for ACC, especially in the Childhood-AYA (C-AYA) population. Further clinical validation can improve precision oncology management of this disease, which is known to have limited therapeutic options.

Pathogenic Germline Variants in 10,389 Adult Cancers
We conducted the largest investigation of predisposition variants in cancer to date, discovering 853 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 8% of 10,389 cases from 33 cancer types. Twenty-one genes showed single or cross-cancer associations, including novel associations of SDHA in melanoma and PALB2 in stomach adenocarcinoma. The 659 predisposition variants and 18 additional large deletions in tumor suppressors, including ATM, BRCA1, and NF1, showed low gene expression and frequent (43%) loss of heterozygosity or biallelic two-hit events. We also discovered 33 such variants in oncogenes, including missenses in MET, RET, and PTPN11 associated with high gene expression. We nominated 47 additional predisposition variants from prioritized VUSs supported by multiple evidences involving case-control frequency, loss of heterozygosity, expression effect, and co-localization with mutations and modified residues. Our integrative approach links rare predisposition variants to functional consequences, informing future guidelines of variant classification and germline genetic testing in cancer.

Exome sequencing reveals germline gain-of-function EGFR mutation in an adult with Lhermitte-Duclos disease
Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) is a rare cerebellar disorder believed to be pathognomonic for Cowden syndrome. Presently, the only known etiology is germline PTEN mutation. We report a 41-yr-old white female diagnosed with LDD and wild-type for PTEN. Exome sequencing revealed a germline heterozygous EGFR mutation that breaks a disulfide bond in the receptor's extracellular domain, resulting in constitutive activation. Functional studies demonstrate activation of ERK/AKT signaling pathways, mimicking PTEN loss-of-function downstream effects. The identification of EGFR as a candidate LDD susceptibility gene contributes to advancement of molecular diagnosis and targeted therapy for this rare condition with limited treatment options.

Epithelial inflammation resulting from an inherited loss-of-function mutation in EGFR
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is fundamentally important for tissue homeostasis through EGFR/ligand interactions that stimulate numerous signal transduction pathways. Aberrant EGFR signaling has been reported in inflammatory and malignant diseases, but thus far no primary inherited defects in EGFR have been recorded. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous loss-of-function missense mutation in EGFR (c.1283 G>A; p.Gly428Asp) in a male infant with lifelong inflammation affecting the skin, bowel, and lungs. During the first year of life, his skin showed erosions, dry scale, and alopecia. Subsequently, there were numerous papules and pustules--similar to the rash seen in patients receiving EGFR inhibitor drugs. Skin biopsy demonstrated an altered cellular distribution of EGFR in the epidermis with reduced cell membrane labeling, and in vitro analysis of the mutant receptor revealed abrogated EGFR phosphorylation and EGF-stimulated downstream signaling. Microarray analysis on the patient's skin highlighted disturbed differentiation/premature terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and upregulation of several inflammatory/innate immune response networks. The boy died at the age of 2.5 years from extensive skin and chest infections as well as electrolyte imbalance. This case highlights the major mechanism of epithelial dysfunction following EGFR signaling ablation and illustrates the broader impact of EGFR inhibition on other tissues.

EGFR mutations cause a lethal syndrome of epithelial dysfunction with progeroid features
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is part of a large family of receptors required for communicating extracellular signals through internal tyrosine kinases. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling is required for tissue development, whereas constitutive activation of this signaling pathway is associated with oncogenic transformation. We identified homozygous c.1283G>A (p.Gly428Asp) mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR in two siblings. The children were born prematurely, had abnormalities in skin and hair, suffered multisystem organ failure, and died in the neonatal period from intestinal perforation. EGF failed to induce mutated receptor phosphorylation in patient-derived fibroblasts and activation of downstream targets was suppressed. The heterologously expressed extracellular domain was impaired in stability and the binding of EGF. Cells from the affected patient undergo early senescence with accelerated expression of Î²-galactosidase and shortened telomeres at all passages when compared to controls. A comparison of homozygous inherited regions from a separate report of a patient from the same ethnic background and EGFR genotype confirms the pathogenicity of EGFR mutations in congenital disease.

Optimizing clinical exome design and parallel gene-testing for recessive genetic conditions in preconception carrier screening: Translational research genomic data from 14,125 exomes
Limited translational genomic research data have been reported on the application of exome sequencing and parallel gene testing for preconception carrier screening (PCS). Here, we present individual-level data from a large PCS program in which exome sequencing was routinely performed on either gamete donors (5,845) or infertile patients (8,280) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment without any known family history of inheritable genetic conditions. Individual-level data on pathogenic variants were used to define conditions for PCS based on criteria for severity, penetrance, inheritance pattern, and age of onset. Fetal risk was defined based on actual carrier frequency data accounting for the specific inheritance pattern (fetal disease risk, FDR). In addition, large-scale application of exome sequencing for PCS allowed a deep investigation of the incidence of medically actionable secondary findings in this population. Exome sequencing achieved remarkable clinical sensitivity for reproductive risk of highly penetrant childhood-onset disorders (1/337 conceptions) through analysis of 114 selected gene-condition pairs. A significant contribution to fetal disease risk was observed for rare (carrier rate < 1:100) and X-linked conditions (16.7% and 41.2% of total FDR, respectively). Subgroup analysis of 776 IVF couples identified 37 at increased reproductive risk (4.8%; 95% CI = 3.4-6.5). Further, two additional couples had increased risk for very rare conditions when both members of a parental pair were treated as a unit and the search was extended to the entire exome. About 2.3% of participants showed at least one pathogenic variant for genes included in the updated American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics v2.0 list of secondary findings. Gamete donors and IVF couples showed similar carrier burden for both carrier screening and secondary findings, indicating no causal relationship to fertility. These translational research data will facilitate development of more effective PCS strategies that maximize clinical sensitivity with minimal counterproductive effects.

The contribution of de novo coding mutations to autism spectrum disorder
Whole exome sequencing has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding the genetic architecture of human disease. Here we apply it to more than 2,500 simplex families, each having a child with an autistic spectrum disorder. By comparing affected to unaffected siblings, we show that 13% of de novo missense mutations and 43% of de novo likely gene-disrupting (LGD) mutations contribute to 12% and 9% of diagnoses, respectively. Including copy number variants, coding de novo mutations contribute to about 30% of all simplex and 45% of female diagnoses. Almost all LGD mutations occur opposite wild-type alleles. LGD targets in affected females significantly overlap the targets in males of lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but neither overlaps significantly with targets in males of higher IQ. We estimate that LGD mutation in about 400 genes can contribute to the joint class of affected females and males of lower IQ, with an overlapping and similar number of genes vulnerable to contributory missense mutation. LGD targets in the joint class overlap with published targets for intellectual disability and schizophrenia, and are enriched for chromatin modifiers, FMRP-associated genes and embryonically expressed genes. Most of the significance for the latter comes from affected females.

Refining the role of de novo protein-truncating variants in neurodevelopmental disorders by using population reference samples
Recent research has uncovered an important role for de novo variation in neurodevelopmental disorders. Using aggregated data from 9,246 families with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, or developmental delay, we found that â¼1/3 of de novo variants are independently present as standing variation in the Exome Aggregation Consortium's cohort of 60,706 adults, and these de novo variants do not contribute to neurodevelopmental risk. We further used a loss-of-function (LoF)-intolerance metric, pLI, to identify a subset of LoF-intolerant genes containing the observed signal of associated de novo protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders. LoF-intolerant genes also carry a modest excess of inherited PTVs, although the strongest de novo-affected genes contribute little to this excess, thus suggesting that the excess of inherited risk resides in lower-penetrant genes. These findings illustrate the importance of population-based reference cohorts for the interpretation of candidate pathogenic variants, even for analyses of complex diseases and de novo variation.

Rates, distribution and implications of postzygotic mosaic mutations in autism spectrum disorder
We systematically analyzed postzygotic mutations (PZMs) in whole-exome sequences from the largest collection of trios (5,947) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) available, including 282 unpublished trios, and performed resequencing using multiple independent technologies. We identified 7.5% of de novo mutations as PZMs, 83.3% of which were not described in previous studies. Damaging, nonsynonymous PZMs within critical exons of prenatally expressed genes were more common in ASD probands than controls (P < 1 Ã 10-6), and genes carrying these PZMs were enriched for expression in the amygdala (P = 5.4 Ã 10-3). Two genes (KLF16 and MSANTD2) were significantly enriched for PZMs genome-wide, and other PZMs involved genes (SCN2A, HNRNPU and SMARCA4) whose mutation is known to cause ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders. PZMs constitute a significant proportion of de novo mutations and contribute importantly to ASD risk.

A variant epidermal growth factor receptor exhibits altered type alpha transforming growth factor binding and transmembrane signaling
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and type alpha transforming growth factor (TGF-alpha) bind to a specific region in subdomain III of the extracellular portion of the EGF receptor (EGFR). Binding leads to receptor dimerization, auto-and transphosphorylation on intracellular tyrosine residues, and activation of signal transduction pathways. We compared the binding and biological actions of EGF and TGF-alpha in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing either wild-type human EGFR (HER497R) or a variant EGFR that has an arginine-to-lysine substitution in the extracellular domain at codon 497 (HER497K) within subdomain IV of EGFR. Both receptors exhibited two orders of binding sites with radioiodinated EGF (125I-EGF). Similar results were obtained with 125I-TGF-alpha in cells expressing HER497R. In contrast, only one order of low-affinity binding sites was seen with 125I-TGF-alpha in the case of HER497K. Although EGF and TGF-alpha enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptors, CHO cells expressing HER497K exhibited an attenuated growth response to EGF and TGF-alpha and a reduced induction of the protooncogenes FOS, JUN, and MYC. Moreover, high concentrations of TGF-alpha (5 nM) inhibited growth in these cells but not in cells expressing HER497R. These findings indicate that a region in subdomain IV of EGFR regulates signal transduction across the cell membrane and selectively modulates that binding characteristics of TGF-alpha.

Epidermal growth factor receptor R497K polymorphism is a favorable prognostic factor for patients with colorectal carcinoma
Purpose:
        
      
      It has been shown that the R497K polymorphism of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has attenuated functions in ligand binding, tyrosine kinase activation, and growth stimulation. Because the activation of EGFR results in an unfavorable prognosis of patients with colorectal carcinoma, a pilot study was conducted to assess the influence of this polymorphism on colorectal carcinoma patients.

R497K polymorphism in epidermal growth factor receptor gene is associated with the risk of acute coronary syndrome
Background:
        
      
      Previous studies suggested that genetic polymorphisms in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene had been implicated in the susceptibility to some tumors and inflammatory diseases. EGFR has been recently implicated in vascular pathophysiological processes associated with excessive remodeling and atherosclerosis. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a clinical manifestation of preceding atherosclerosis. Our purpose was to investigate the association of the EGFR polymorphism with the risk of ACS. In this context, we analyzed the HER-1 R497K and EGFR intron 1 (CA)n repeat polymorphisms in 191 patients with ACS and 210 age- and sex-matched controls in a Chinese population, using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) strategy and direct sequencing.

Identification of recurrent BRCA1 mutation and its clinical relevance in Chinese Triple-negative breast cancer cohort
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15-20% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers, and is enriched for germline mutation of BRCA. In Asian patients diagnosed with breast cancer, 268 deleterious mutations of BRCA1 and 242 of BRCA2 have been identified so far, including a reported BRCA1 frameshift mutation (rs80350973), apparently found only in Asian people, with a low prevalence of 0.3-1.7% in different breast cancer cohorts. Here, we reported the high prevalence (7.2%) of rs80350973 among 125 Chinese patients with TNBC, which implies its mutational predilection for certain breast cancer subtypes. Although its low prevalence had not indicated any particular clinical significance in previous studies, our results associated rs80350973 mutation with cell checkpoint malfunction, and was found to be more common in TNBC patients with high Ki-67 indices (P = 0.004). As Ki-67 overexpression is a predictor of poor prognosis in TNBC, inclusion of this mutation into genetic assessments may improve the clinical management of Chinese patients with TNBC.

Purpose:
        
      
      Few and small studies have been reported about multigene testing usage by massively parallel sequencing in European cancer families. There is an open debate about what genes should be tested, and the actionability of some included genes is under research.

Profiling of potential driver mutations in sarcomas by targeted next generation sequencing
Comprehensive genetic profiling by massively parallel sequencing, commonly known as next generation sequencing (NGS), is becoming the foundation of personalized oncology. For sarcomas very few targeted treatments are currently in routine use. In clinical practice the preoperative diagnostic workup of soft tissue tumours largely relies on core needle biopsies. Although mostly sufficient for histopathological diagnosis, only very limited amounts of formalin fixated paraffin embedded tissue are often available for predictive mutation analysis. Targeted NGS may thus open up new possibilities for comprehensive characterization of scarce biopsies. We therefore set out to search for driver mutations by NGS in a cohort of 55 clinically and morphologically well characterized sarcomas using low input of DNA from formalin fixated paraffin embedded tissues. The aim was to investigate if there are any recurrent or targetable aberrations in cancer driver genes in addition to known chromosome translocations in different types of sarcomas. We employed a panel covering 207 mutation hotspots in 50 cancer-associated genes to analyse DNA from nine gastrointestinal stromal tumours, 14 synovial sarcomas, seven myxoid liposarcomas, 22 Ewing sarcomas and three Ewing-like small round cell tumours at a large sequencing depth to detect also mutations that are subclonal or occur at low allele frequencies. We found nine mutations in eight different potential driver genes, some of which are potentially actionable by currently existing targeted therapies. Even though no recurrent mutations in driver genes were found in the different sarcoma groups, we show that targeted NGS-based sequencing is clearly feasible in a diagnostic setting with very limited amounts of paraffin embedded tissue and may provide novel insights into mesenchymal cell signalling and potentially druggable targets. Interestingly, we also identify five non-synonymous sequence variants in 4 established cancer driver genes in DNA from normal tissue from sarcoma patients that may possibly predispose or contribute to neoplastic development.

Patterns and functional implications of rare germline variants across 12 cancer types
Large-scale cancer sequencing data enable discovery of rare germline cancer susceptibility variants. Here we systematically analyse 4,034 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer cases representing 12 cancer types. We find that the frequency of rare germline truncations in 114 cancer-susceptibility-associated genes varies widely, from 4% (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)) to 19% (ovarian cancer), with a notably high frequency of 11% in stomach cancer. Burden testing identifies 13 cancer genes with significant enrichment of rare truncations, some associated with specific cancers (for example, RAD51C, PALB2 and MSH6 in AML, stomach and endometrial cancers, respectively). Significant, tumour-specific loss of heterozygosity occurs in nine genes (ATM, BAP1, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, FANCM, PALB2 and RAD51C/D). Moreover, our homology-directed repair assay of 68 BRCA1 rare missense variants supports the utility of allelic enrichment analysis for characterizing variants of unknown significance. The scale of this analysis and the somatic-germline integration enable the detection of rare variants that may affect individual susceptibility to tumour development, a critical step toward precision medicine.

Sex-Based Analysis of De Novo Variants in Neurodevelopmental Disorders
While genes with an excess of de novo mutations (DNMs) have been identified in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), few studies focus on DNM patterns where the sex of affected children is examined separately. We considered â¼8,825 sequenced parent-child trios (n â¼26,475 individuals) and identify 54 genes with a DNM enrichment in males (n = 18), females (n = 17), or overlapping in both the male and female subsets (n = 19). A replication cohort of 18,778 sequenced parent-child trios (n = 56,334 individuals) confirms 25 genes (n = 3 in males, n = 7 in females, n = 15 in both male and female subsets). As expected, we observe significant enrichment on the X chromosome for females but also find autosomal genes with potential sex bias (females, CDK13, ITPR1; males, CHD8, MBD5, SYNGAP1); 6.5% of females harbor a DNM in a female-enriched gene, whereas 2.7% of males have a DNM in a male-enriched gene. Sex-biased genes are enriched in transcriptional processes and chromatin binding, primarily reside in the nucleus of cells, and have brain expression. By downsampling, we find that DNM gene discovery is greatest when studying affected females. Finally, directly comparing de novo allele counts in NDD-affected males and females identifies one replicated genome-wide significant gene (DDX3X) with locus-specific enrichment in females. Our sex-based DNM enrichment analysis identifies candidate NDD genes differentially affecting males and females and indicates that the study of females with NDDs leads to greater gene discovery consistent with the female-protective effect.

EGFR and ERBB2 Germline Mutations in Chinese Lung Cancer Patients and Their Roles in Genetic Susceptibility to Cancer
Introduction:
        
      
      Inherited genetic determinants of lung cancer risk remain relatively elusive. Germline mutations in EGFR and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) have been previously reported in lung cancers that may be associated with genetic susceptibility to lung cancer.

Germ-line mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are rare but may contribute to oncogenesis: a novel germ-line mutation in EGFR detected in a patient with lung adenocarcinoma
Background:
        
      
      A subset of lung cancer patients harbour EGFR somatic mutations in their tumours and are candidates for treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In a few cases EGFR mutations have also been found in the germ line, suggesting a role in lung carcinogenesis. Objetives of this study were: 1) To analyze the EGFR gene mutations in a population diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma from Northern Spain. 2) To determine the frequency of a new germ-line mutation found in our laboratory as well as the frequency in our population of three other EGFR germ-line mutations detected by other authors. 3) To determine whether the novel mutation detected may have a functional effect on the EGFR protein.

Mutation and polymorphism in the EGFR-TK domain associated with lung cancer
Background:
        
      
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in the development and progression of lung cancer. Somatic EGFR mutations are predictors of response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors (TKIs) for lung cancer, especially among never smokers. EGFR mutations may occur independently of other genetic alterations.

Polymorphisms in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene and the risk of primary lung cancer: a case-control study
Background:
        
      
      Polymorphisms in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene may influence EGFR production and/or activity, thereby modulating susceptibility to lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the association between polymorphisms in the EGFR gene and the risk of lung cancer in a Korean population.

Inherited susceptibility to lung cancer may be associated with the T790M drug resistance mutation in EGFR
Somatic activating mutations in EGFR identify a subset of non-small cell lung cancer that respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Acquisition of drug resistance is linked to a specific secondary somatic mutation, EGFR T790M. Here we describe a family with multiple cases of non-small cell lung cancer associated with germline transmission of this mutation. Four of six tumors analyzed showed a secondary somatic activating EGFR mutation, arising in cis with the germline EGFR mutation T790M. These observations implicate altered EGFR signaling in genetic susceptibility to lung cancer.

Novel mutant-selective EGFR kinase inhibitors against EGFR T790M
The clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is limited by the development of drug-resistance mutations, including the gatekeeper T790M mutation. Strategies targeting EGFR T790M with irreversible inhibitors have had limited success and are associated with toxicity due to concurrent inhibition of wild-type EGFR. All current EGFR inhibitors possess a structurally related quinazoline-based core scaffold and were identified as ATP-competitive inhibitors of wild-type EGFR. Here we identify a covalent pyrimidine EGFR inhibitor by screening an irreversible kinase inhibitor library specifically against EGFR T790M. These agents are 30- to 100-fold more potent against EGFR T790M, and up to 100-fold less potent against wild-type EGFR, than quinazoline-based EGFR inhibitors in vitro. They are also effective in murine models of lung cancer driven by EGFR T790M. Co-crystallization studies reveal a structural basis for the increased potency and mutant selectivity of these agents. These mutant-selective irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors may be clinically more effective and better tolerated than quinazoline-based inhibitors. Our findings demonstrate that functional pharmacological screens against clinically important mutant kinases represent a powerful strategy to identify new classes of mutant-selective kinase inhibitors.

Identification of the rare EGFR mutation p.G796S as somatic and germline mutation in white patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
Background:
        
      
      Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are involved in tumorigenesis and response to targeted therapies in distinct cancer types. Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) show an incidence of EGFR mutations varying from 7% in Asians to 0% to 4% in white patients. Mutational screening predominantly focuses on the analysis of hotspot regions of EGFR (exons 19 and 21).

Identification of Novel Candidate Genes for Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer Susceptibility
Approximately 25-30% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases are expected to result from a genetic predisposition, but in only 5-10% of these cases highly penetrant germline mutations are found. The remaining CRC heritability is still unexplained, and may be caused by a hitherto-undefined set of rare variants with a moderately penetrant risk. Here we aimed to identify novel risk factors for early-onset CRC using whole-exome sequencing, which was performed on a cohort of CRC individuals (n = 55) with a disease onset before 45 years of age. We searched for genes that were recurrently affected by rare variants (minor allele frequency â¤ 0.001) with potentially damaging effects and, subsequently, re-sequenced the candidate genes in a replication cohort of 174 early-onset or familial CRC individuals. Two functionally relevant genes with low frequency variants with potentially damaging effects, PTPN12 and LRP6, were found in at least three individuals. The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST, encoded by PTPN12, is a regulator of cell motility and LRP6 is a component of the WNT-FZD-LRP5-LRP6 complex that triggers WNT signaling. All variants in LRP6 were identified in individuals with an extremely early-onset of the disease (â¤30 years of age), and two of the three variants showed increased WNT signaling activity in vitro. In conclusion, we present PTPN12 and LRP6 as novel candidates contributing to the heterogeneous susceptibility to CRC.

Novel germline mutation: EGFR V843I in patient with multiple lung adenocarcinomas and family members with lung cancer
A novel germline transmission of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation V843I in a family with multiple members with lung cancer is reported. The proband was a 70-year-old woman with multiple adenocarcinomas who exhibited secondary EGFR mutations, either L858R or L861Q, in the specimens of resected tumors, in addition to a germline EGFR V843I mutation. These observations suggest that the germline EGFR V843I mutation might have altered EGFR signaling in the multicentric development of adenocarcinoma, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and also might have had a role in the development of lung cancer in multiple members of her family.

A dramatic lung cancer course in a patient with a rare EGFR germline mutation exon 21 V843I: Is EGFR TKI resistance predictable?
We report on the medical history of a Caucasian smoker woman diagnosed with a stage IV NSCLC adenocarcinoma, characterized by a rare epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) point mutation in exon 21 codon 843 (p.V843I/c.2527G>A/COSMIC ID 85894). This genetic alteration revealed to be germline, after its presence was demonstrated in chondroblasts from the bone biopsy. While it is the first description of germline V843I mutation without concomitant additional known EGFR activating mutation, we modeled the EGFR ATP catalytic domain in complex with ATP, gefitinib and erlotinib using computer-aided approaches to estimate possible changes in affinity upon the V843I mutation.

Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation testing in the care of lung cancer patients
As the literature about epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations grows and screening for mutations becomes increasingly integrated into clinical care, it is important to examine how best to do somatic mutational analyses and how best to use the test results in clinical decision making. We began offering mutation screening by comprehensive direct sequence analysis of exons 18 to 24 of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR in August 2004 as part of clinical cancer care and protocol therapy at our institutions. All identified potential mutations are confirmed with three to five independent PCRs of the original genomic DNA sample and, if not previously noted in the literature, are compared with the patient's germ-line DNA to ensure the finding is somatic. We formally analyzed the first 100 patients to undergo EGFR sequence analysis and found that testing was feasible and significantly affected the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients harboring EGFR mutations were significantly more likely to receive recommendations for therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (i.e., gefitinib or erlotinib) than patients without mutations. However, negative EGFR test results did not prevent physicians from administering these agents to selected patients. Ideally, a standardized technique for mutation testing could be developed, with demonstrated reproducibility and validity. Clinical trials incorporating molecular diagnostics are ongoing to assess the efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors as first-line therapy for metastatic NSCLC and as adjuvant therapy for early-stage resected NSCLC. It is likely that mutation testing and other molecular analyses will be most useful in these two clinical situations.

Investigating the function of three non-synonymous SNPs in EGFR gene: structural modelling and association with breast cancer
Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) represent common genomic variations that alter protein sequence and function. Some nsSNPs affecting conserved amino acids have been reported to be associated with cancer susceptibility. Interestingly, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is commonly overexpressed and mutated in many cancers. In this study, we investigated the structural effect of three deleterious nsSNPs: rs17337451 (R962G), rs1140476 (R977C) and rs17290699 (H988P) within EGFR using computational tools. The modelled mutant dimers showed less stability than wild type EGFR dimer. Furthermore, we showed the important role of R962 and H988 residues in the EGFR dimer formation. We also report preliminary experimental data for SNP R977C suggesting that the variant C977 might confer greater risk for breast cancer. These results contribute to an improved understanding of the EGFR dimer stability and provide new elements for understanding the relationship between EGFR and cancer.

Identification of non-coding genetic variants in samples from hypoxemic respiratory disease patients that affect the transcriptional response to hypoxia
A wide range of diseases course with an unbalance between the consumption of oxygen by tissues and its supply. This situation triggers a transcriptional response, mediated by the hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), that aims to restore oxygen homeostasis. Little is known about the inter-individual variation in this response and its role in the progression of disease. Herein, we sought to identify common genetic variants mapping to hypoxia response elements (HREs) and characterize their effect on transcription. To this end, we constructed a list of genome-wide HIF-binding regions from publicly available experimental datasets and studied the genetic variability in these regions by targeted re-sequencing of genomic samples from 96 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 144 obstructive sleep apnea patients. This study identified 14 frequent variants disrupting potential HREs. The analysis of the genomic regions containing these variants by means of reporter assays revealed that variants rs1009329, rs6593210 and rs150921338 impaired the transcriptional response to hypoxia. Finally, using genome editing we confirmed the functional role of rs6593210 in the transcriptional regulation of EGFR. In summary, we found that inter-individual variability in non-coding regions affect the response to hypoxia and could potentially impact on the progression of pulmonary diseases.

Polymorphism in Sp1 recognition site of the EGF receptor gene promoter and risk of glioblastoma
We investigated two polymorphisms of the epidermal growth factor receptor promoter as potential risk factors and prognostic markers for glioblastoma. The -216T allele (which results in a 30% higher activity) was more frequent in the patients compared with the control population (224/376 = 59.6% vs 165/352 = 46.8%; p = 0.0006) corresponding to an odd ratio of 1.67 (1.24; 2.25). A modest difference in median survival was also associated with the TT genotype.

A functional common polymorphism in a Sp1 recognition site of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene promoter
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a prominent role in cell growth and development. Its regulation in humans is complex and incompletely understood. In this study, 12 new polymorphisms were discovered in the 5'-regulatory region of EGFR gene and 2 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (-216G/T and -191C/A) were found in the essential promoter area, one of which is located in a Sp1 recognition site (-216). Transient transfection in human cancer and primary cell lines showed significantly different promoter activity between the two most common haplotypes (-216G-191C and -216T-191C). The replacement of G by T at position -216 increases the promoter activity by 30%. A transient transfection assay in the Sp1-deficient cell line (Schneider cell line 2) showed a strong dependence of EGFR promoter activity on Sp1 and confirmed the effect of the aforementioned polymorphisms. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay also showed a significantly higher binding efficiency of nuclear protein or pure Sp1 protein to the T allele compared with the G allele. We then investigated the allelic imbalance of EGFR transcription in fibroblast cell lines with heterozygous genotype at -216G/T but C/C homozygous genotype at -191C/A. The expression of mRNA carrying T-C haplotype was significantly stronger compared with that of G-C haplotype (P < 0.02). Thus, we successfully showed that a common polymorphism in the EGFR promoter was associated with altered promoter activity and gene expression both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings have implications for cancer etiology and therapy and may also be relevant to the inherited susceptibility of other common diseases.

EGFR 3'UTR 774T>C polymorphism contributes to bladder cancer risk
Much evidence show that over-expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in regulating carcinogenesis. Genetic variations in 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of gene have been reported to affect gene expression by interfering with microRNAs (miRNAs), which are thought to function as either tumour suppressors or oncogenes by binding to their target mRNA. In this study, we investigated the association between the EGFR 3'UTR 774T>C polymorphism and bladder cancer risk. We used the TaqMan technology to genotype this genetic variant in a hospital-based case-control study of 908 bladder cancer patients and 1239 controls in a Chinese population. We found that the 774CC genotype was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of bladder cancer [adjusted odds ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.58], compared with the 774TT/TC genotype, and this increased risk was more pronounced among subgroups of age > 65 years, non-smokers and patients' tumour invasive stage. Furthermore, luciferase assays in T24 cell showed that EGFR 3'UTR 774 T to C substitution could increase the expression of EGFR, which was consistent with the association study finding. Additionally, we also provide evidence that 774T>C polymorphism increasing EGFR expression was not regulated by hsa-miR-214 binding. These findings suggested that EGFR 3'UTR 774T>C polymorphism may contribute to susceptibility to bladder cancer.

A single nucleotide polymorphism in 3' untranslated region of epithelial growth factor receptor confers risk for pulmonary hypertension in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Objective:
        
      
      Polymorphisms located at microRNA (miRNA) binding sites may interfere with the miRNA/mRNA interaction. The objective of this study was to identify the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (774 T>C) in 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as to explore the molecular mechanism.

The risk variant rs884225 within EGFR impairs miR-103a-3p's anti-tumourigenic function in non-small cell lung cancer
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status is the major determinant of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy selection. Studies have hinted that EGFR antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors were beneficial in patients with EGFR mutation-negative but EGFR-overexpressing of NSCLC. However, the mechanisms underlying EGFR amplification and overexpression in NSCLC remain largely unknown. Here, we report that rs884225, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the EGFR 3'-terminal untranslated region, was significantly associated with EGFR expression level and contributed to NSCLC susceptibility. Mechanistically, the rs884225 C allele enhanced EGFR expression by altering the miR-103a-3p binding site, thus impairing miR-103a-3p's anti-tumourigenic function. As a tumour suppressor gene, miR-103a-3p expression correlated with overall and recurrence-free survival in NSCLC patients. Furthermore, miR-103a-3p inhibited growth and metastasis via effects on the KRAS pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in EGFR wild-type NSCLC cell lines, respectively, which substantially reduced EGFR expression and activity. Thus, rs884225 may be a biomarker for NSCLC susceptibility, and miR-103a-3p may be a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC.

Genomic diagnostics within a medically underserved population: efficacy and implications
PurposeWe integrated whole-exome sequencing (WES) and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) into a clinical workflow to serve an endogamous, uninsured, agrarian community.MethodsSeventy-nine probands (newborn to 49.8 years) who presented between 1998 and 2015 remained undiagnosed after biochemical and molecular investigations. We generated WES data for probands and family members and vetted variants through rephenotyping, segregation analyses, and population studies.ResultsThe most common presentation was neurological disease (64%). Seven (9%) probands were diagnosed by CMA. Family WES data were informative for 37 (51%) of the 72 remaining individuals, yielding a specific genetic diagnosis (n = 32) or revealing a novel molecular etiology (n = 5). For five (7%) additional subjects, negative WES decreased the likelihood of genetic disease. Compared to trio analysis, "family" WES (average seven exomes per proband) reduced filtered candidate variants from 22 Â± 6 to 5 Â± 3 per proband. Nineteen (51%) alleles were de novo and 17 (46%) inherited; the latter added to a population-based diagnostic panel. We found actionable secondary variants in 21 (4.2%) of 502 subjects, all of whom opted to be informed.ConclusionCMA and family-based WES streamline and economize diagnosis of rare genetic disorders, accelerate novel gene discovery, and create new opportunities for community-based screening and prevention in underserved populations.

Development of a Novel Next-Generation Sequencing Assay for Carrier Screening in Old Order Amish and Mennonite Populations of Pennsylvania
Genetically isolated populations, such as the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite communities, have an increased incidence of specific autosomal recessive disorders caused by the founder effect. In these populations, robust expanded carrier screening and diagnostic testing have the potential to reduce overall medical costs and improve patient outcomes. A novel next-generation sequencing assay was developed using anchored multiplex PCR technology (ArcherDX) for 162 different genetic syndromes caused by 202 pathogenic variants consisting of 150 single-nucleotide changes, 43 small insertion/deletions, and 9 large deletions (>20 nucleotides). To assess the accuracy of the screening panel results, 48 samples were selected on the basis of prior whole exome sequencing results. An additional 15 samples were chosen specifically to validate SMN1 and SMN2 copy number analyses. Collectively, the screening panel detected 273 pathogenic single-nucleotide or small insertion/deletion variants, 35 copy number variations, and 1 chromosomal abnormality (Klinefelter syndrome). Concordance with prior whole exome sequencing was 100%. By using a novel next-generation sequencing workflow, a successful targeted gene variant panel was developed for the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite populations of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Population-wide carrier screening may help decrease the morbidity and mortality of these conditions in the high-risk populations.

EGFR CA repeat polymorphism predict clinical outcome in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib
Objectives:
        
      
      Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are predictors of efficacy for treatment with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A CA repeat polymorphism in intron 1 of the EGFR gene influences the transcription of the EGFR gene. This study evaluates the association between the CA repeat polymorphism and outcome in NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib.

Modulation of epidermal growth factor receptor gene transcription by a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in intron 1
The influence of a highly polymorphic CA dinucleotide repeat in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene on transcription was examined with a quantitative nuclear run-off method. We could demonstrate that transcription of the EGFR gene is inhibited by approximately 80% in alleles with 21 CA repeats. In experiments with polymerase chain reaction products that spanned a region of more than 4,000 base pairs and contained the promoter, two enhancers, and the polymorphic region in the first intron of the gene, we found that transcription activity declines with increasing numbers of CA dinucleotides. In vivo pre-mRNA expression data from cultured cell lines support these findings, although other regulation mechanisms can outweigh this effect. In addition, we showed that under our experimental conditions RNA elongation terminates at a site closely downstream of the simple sequence repeat and that there are two separate major transcription start sites. Our results provide new insights in individually different EGFR gene expression and the role of the CA repeat in transcription of this proto-oncogene.

Functional EGFR germline polymorphisms may confer risk for EGFR somatic mutations in non-small cell lung cancer, with a predominant effect on exon 19 microdeletions
Somatic mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain play a critical role in the development and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Strong genetic influence on susceptibility to these mutations has been suggested. To identify the genetic factors conferring risk for the EGFR tyrosine kinase mutations in NSCLC, a case-control study was conducted in 141 Taiwanese NSCLC patients by focusing on three functional polymorphisms in the EGFR gene [-216G/T, intron 1 (CA)n, and R497K]. Allelic imbalance of the EGFR -216G/T polymorphism was also tested in the heterozygous patients and in the NCI-60 cancer cell lines to further verify its function. We found that the frequencies of the alleles -216T and CA-19 are significantly higher in the patients with any mutation (P = 0.032 and 0.01, respectively), in particular in those with exon 19 microdeletions (P = 0.006 and 0.033, respectively), but not in the patients with L858R mutation. The -216T allele is favored to be amplified in both tumor DNA of lung cancer patients and cancer cell lines. We conclude that the local haplotype structures across the EGFR gene may favor the development of cellular malignancies and thus significantly confer risk to the occurrence of EGFR mutations in NSCLC, particularly the exon 19 microdeletions.

Association of the EGFR intron 1 CA repeat length with lung cancer risk
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in the development and progression of lung cancer. A previous report noted that an increased number of polymorphic CA repeats in the first intron of the EGFR gene results in decreased transcriptional activity. To estimate the association of the length of polymorphic CA repeats in intron 1 of the EGFR gene with lung cancer, a case-control study of 176 lung cancer patients and 161 controls was conducted in Caucasians. This case-control study is based on two existing prospective cohorts: the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) and the Lung Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) at the University of Pittsburgh. The frequencies of the SL (one allele>16 repeats), and SS (both allele<or=16 repeats) genotypes were statistically higher among the cases than in the controls (OR: 1.94 and 3.04, 95% CI: 1.16-3.23 and 1.53-6.04, P-value: 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). When the length of EGFR-CA repeat was analyzed by the sum of the number of repeats in two alleles, the frequency of the shorter repeats (sum<or=36) was 79.6% versus 63.4%, respectively, and the frequency of the longer repeats (sum>36) was 20.5% versus 36.7%, for lung cancer cases versus controls. The lower sum of EGFR-CA repeats associated with the risk of lung cancer; the estimated odds ratio was 2.25 with 95% confidence interval: 1.38-3.66 (P=0.001). Associations involving EGFR-CA repeat genotype and EGFR-CA repeat sum remained significant when adjusted for age, gender, and tobacco exposure. Our study, which is preliminary, demonstrates for the first time that shorter EGFR-CA repeats associate with lung cancer risk. The number of EGFR-CA repeats identifies a possible susceptible population to lung cancer.

Targeted sequencing of 36 known or putative colorectal cancer susceptibility genes
Background:
        
      
      Mutations in several genes predispose to colorectal cancer. Genetic testing for hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes was previously limited to single gene tests; thus, only a very limited number of genes were tested, and rarely those infrequently mutated in colorectal cancer. Next-generation sequencing technologies have made it possible to sequencing panels of genes known and suspected to influence colorectal cancer susceptibility.

Higher-than-expected population prevalence of potentially pathogenic germline TP53 variants in individuals unselected for cancer history
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal-dominant cancer predisposition disorder associated with pathogenic germline variants in TP53, with a high penetrance over an individual's lifetime. The actual population prevalence of pathogenic germline TP53 mutations is still unclear, most likely due to biased selection of cancer affected families. The aim of this study was to estimate the population prevalence of potentially pathogenic TP53 exonic variants in three sequencing databases, totaling 63,983 unrelated individuals. Potential pathogenicity was defined using an original algorithm combining bioinformatic prediction tools, suggested clinical significance, and functional data. We identified 34 different potentially pathogenic TP53 variants in 131 out of 63,983 individuals (0.2%). Twenty-eight (82%) of these variants fell within the DNA-binding domain of TP53, with an enrichment for specific variants that were not previously identified as LFS mutation hotspots, such as the p.R290H and p.N235S variants. Our findings reveal that the population prevalence of potentially pathogenic TP53 variants may be up to 10 times higher than previously estimated from family-based studies. These results point to the need for further studies aimed at evaluating cancer penetrance modifiers as well as the risk associated between cancer and rare TP53 variants.

Germline pathogenic variants of 11 breast cancer genes in 7,051 Japanese patients and 11,241 controls
Pathogenic variants in highly penetrant genes are useful for the diagnosis, therapy, and surveillance for hereditary breast cancer. Large-scale studies are needed to inform future testing and variant classification processes in Japanese. We performed a case-control association study for variants in coding regions of 11 hereditary breast cancer genes in 7051 unselected breast cancer patients and 11,241 female controls of Japanese ancestry. Here, we identify 244 germline pathogenic variants. Pathogenic variants are found in 5.7% of patients, ranging from 15% in women diagnosed <40 years to 3.2% in patients â¥80 years, with BRCA1/2, explaining two-thirds of pathogenic variants identified at all ages. BRCA1/2, PALB2, and TP53 are significant causative genes. Patients with pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 or PTEN have significantly younger age at diagnosis. In conclusion, BRCA1/2, PALB2, and TP53 are the major hereditary breast cancer genes, irrespective of age at diagnosis, in Japanese women.

TP53 germline mutations in the context of families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer: a clinical challenge
Purpose:
        
      
      TP53germline (g) mutations, associated with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), have rarely been reported in the context of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). The prevalence and cancer risks in this target group are unknown and counseling remains challenging. Notably an extensive high-risk surveillance program is implemented, which evokes substantial psychological discomfort. Emphasizing the lack of consensus about clinical implications, we aim to further characterize TP53g mutations in HBOC families.

A quantitative model to predict pathogenicity of missense variants in the TP53 gene
Germline pathogenic variants in the TP53 gene cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a condition that predisposes individuals to a wide range of cancer types. Identification of individuals carrying a TP53 pathogenic variant is linked to clinical management decisions, such as the avoidance of radiotherapy and use of high-intensity screening programs. The aim of this study was to develop an evidence-based quantitative model that integrates independent in silico data (Align-GVGD and BayesDel) and somatic to germline ratio (SGR), to assign pathogenicity to every possible missense variant in the TP53 gene. To do this, a likelihood ratio for pathogenicity (LR) was derived from each component calibrated using reference sets of assumed pathogenic and benign missense variants. A posterior probability of pathogenicity was generated by combining LRs, and algorithm outputs were validated using different approaches. A total of 730 TP53 missense variants could be assigned to a clinically interpretable class. The outputs of the model correlated well with existing clinical information, functional data, and ClinVar classifications. In conclusion, these quantitative outputs provide the basis for individualized assessment of cancer risk useful for clinical interpretation. In addition, we propose the value of the novel SGR approach for use within the ACMG/AMP guidelines for variant classification.

Specifications of the ACMG/AMP variant interpretation guidelines for germline TP53 variants
Germline pathogenic variants in TP53 are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a cancer predisposition disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern associated with a high risk of malignancy, including early-onset breast cancers, sarcomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, and brain tumors. Intense cancer surveillance for individuals with TP53 germline pathogenic variants is associated with reduced cancer-related mortality. Accurate and consistent classification of germline variants across clinical and research laboratories is important to ensure appropriate cancer surveillance recommendations. Here, we describe the work performed by the Clinical Genome Resource TP53 Variant Curation Expert Panel (ClinGen TP53 VCEP) focused on specifying the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines for germline variant classification to the TP53 gene. Specifications were developed for 20 ACMG/AMP criteria, while nine were deemed not applicable. The original strength level for the 10 criteria was also adjusted due to current evidence. Use of TP53-specific guidelines and sharing of clinical data among experts and clinical laboratories led to a decrease in variants of uncertain significance from 28% to 12% compared with the original guidelines. The ClinGen TP53 VCEP recommends the use of these TP53-specific ACMG/AMP guidelines as the standard strategy for TP53 germline variant classification.

De novo childhood myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease with unique molecular characteristics
Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative uclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U) is a rare myeloid neoplasm characterized by myelodysplasia and myeloproliferation at the time of initial presentation, which is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. The molecular pathogenesis of MDS/MPN-U patients remains to be elucidated. Among five patients diagnosed with MDS/MPN-U, three patients harboured RUNX1 (AML1) mutations; one carried somatic mosaicism of RUNX1 mutation with JAK2(V617F) mutation and one had dual RUNX1 and FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutations with progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Germline mutation of TP53 was detected as a sole genetic lesion in one patient. JAK2(V617F) and somatic mosaicism of KRAS and TET2 mutations co-existed in one patient. Otherwise, no alterations were detected in PTPN11, NRAS, CBL and ASXL1 genes. ETV6-PDGFRB fusion transcript was not detected in all patients. Four patients recieved haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); three patients relapsed and one achieved complete remission after three donor lymphocyte infusions. Our findings suggest that the mutational spectrum observed in childhood MDS/MPN-U is quite different from that seen in juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia and, to some extent, resemble chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Moreover, two patients had constitutional alterations of genes frequently found in AML. Further investigations are required to define the roles of these genetic alterations in the pathogenesis of childhood MDS/MPN-U.

Novel somatic and germline mutations in intracranial germ cell tumours
Intracranial germ cell tumours (IGCTs) are a group of rare heterogeneous brain tumours that are clinically and histologically similar to the more common gonadal GCTs. IGCTs show great variation in their geographical and gender distribution, histological composition and treatment outcomes. The incidence of IGCTs is historically five- to eightfold greater in Japan and other East Asian countries than in Western countries, with peak incidence near the time of puberty. About half of the tumours are located in the pineal region. The male-to-female incidence ratio is approximately 3-4:1 overall, but is even higher for tumours located in the pineal region. Owing to the scarcity of tumour specimens available for research, little is currently known about this rare disease. Here we report the analysis of 62 cases by next-generation sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism array and expression array. We find the KIT/RAS signalling pathway frequently mutated in more than 50% of IGCTs, including novel recurrent somatic mutations in KIT, its downstream mediators KRAS and NRAS, and its negative regulator CBL. Novel somatic alterations in the AKT/mTOR pathway included copy number gains of the AKT1 locus at 14q32.33 in 19% of patients, with corresponding upregulation of AKT1 expression. We identified loss-of-function mutations in BCORL1, a transcriptional co-repressor and tumour suppressor. We report significant enrichment of novel and rare germline variants in JMJD1C, which codes for a histone demethylase and is a coactivator of the androgen receptor, among Japanese IGCT patients. This study establishes a molecular foundation for understanding the biology of IGCTs and suggests potentially promising therapeutic strategies focusing on the inhibition of KIT/RAS activation and the AKT1/mTOR pathway.

Germline Mutations in Cancer Susceptibility Genes in a Large Series of Unselected Breast Cancer Patients
Purpose: The prevalence of mutations in cancer susceptibility genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 and other cancer susceptibility genes and their clinical relevance are largely unknown among a large series of unselected breast cancer patients in the Chinese population.Experimental Design: A total of 8,085 consecutive unselected Chinese breast cancer patients were enrolled. Germline mutations in 46 cancer susceptibility genes were detected using a 62-gene panel.Results: Pathogenic mutations were identified in 9.2% of patients among the 8,085 unselected breast cancer patients. Of these, 5.3% of patients carried a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (1.8% in BRCA1 and 3.5% in BRCA2), 2.9% carried other breast cancer susceptibility genes (BOCG) and 1.0% carried another cancer susceptibility genes. Triple-negative breast cancers had the highest prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations (11.2%) and other BOCG mutations (3.8%) among the four molecular subgroups, whereas ER-/PR-HER2+ breast cancers had the lowest mutations in BRCA1/2 (1.8%) and BOCG (1.6%). In addition, BRCA1 mutation carriers had a significant worse disease-free survival [unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-2.34; P = 0.014] and disease-specific survival (unadjusted HR 1.96; 95% CI, 1.03-3.65; P = 0.040) than did non-carriers, whereas no significant difference in survival was found between BRCA2 mutation carriers and non-carriers.Conclusions: 9.2% of breast cancer patients carry a pathogenic mutation in cancer susceptibility genes in this large unselected series. Triple-negative breast cancers have the highest prevalence of mutations in BRCA1 /2 and other breast cancer susceptibility genes among the four molecular subgroups, whereas ER-/PR-HER2+ breast cancers had the lowest mutations in these genes.

Frequent occurrence of gastric cancer in Asian kindreds with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Type of cancer and age of onset in individuals with inherited aberrations in the tumour suppressor gene TP53 are variable, possibly influenced by genetic modifiers and different environmental exposure. Since 2009, the modified Chompret criteria (MCC) have been used to identify individuals for TP53 mutation screening. Using the TP53 mutation database maintained by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), we investigated if the MCC, mainly developed for a Caucasian population, was also applicable in Asia. We identified several differences in Asian families compared with similar Caucasian cohorts, suggesting that identification and management of Li-Fraumeni syndrome in Asia do not completely mirror that of North America and Western Europe. Early gastric cancer (<40 years) may be considered a new addition to the MCC especially for Asian families.

Identification and characterization of a novel germ line p53 mutation in familial gastric cancer in the Japanese population
Germ line mutations of the p53 gene are known to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and a germ line p53 mutation has recently been reported in a small subset of familial gastric cancer (FGC) in Europe and Korea. Although the incidence of gastric cancer is very high in Japan and familial clustering is not uncommon, there has been little information on the genetic factors of FGC. Therefore, to determine the role of germ line p53 mutations in FGC in the Japanese population in this study, we used sequencing analysis to examine 80 individuals from 35 Japanese FGC families without germ line CDH1 mutations for germ line p53 mutations. One missense (c.91G>A: p.Val31Ile) and two intronic germ line mutations were found, and transcriptional activity of the Ile31 mutant on p53-responsive genes was examined to determine the functional effect of the novel p.Val31Ile germ line mutation. A luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of p21 (CDKN1A) and MDM2 promoters but not of the BAX promoter was significantly lower in the Ile31-type p53 than in the wild-type (wt) p53. Next, doxycycline-regulated p53-inducible H1299 cell lines were established by applying a retrovirus-mediated gene transfer system to a p53-null human H1299 cell line. Under similar p53 expression conditions shown by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, a cell proliferation assay showed that the Ile31-type p53 had significantly lower cell proliferation suppressing activity than wt p53. These results suggest that Ile31-type p53 may be partly involved in FGC because of its low transcriptional activity and low cell proliferation suppressing activity.

Germline variation in cancer-susceptibility genes in a healthy, ancestrally diverse cohort: implications for individual genome sequencing
Technological advances coupled with decreasing costs are bringing whole genome and whole exome sequencing closer to routine clinical use. One of the hurdles to clinical implementation is the high number of variants of unknown significance. For cancer-susceptibility genes, the difficulty in interpreting the clinical relevance of the genomic variants is compounded by the fact that most of what is known about these variants comes from the study of highly selected populations, such as cancer patients or individuals with a family history of cancer. The genetic variation in known cancer-susceptibility genes in the general population has not been well characterized to date. To address this gap, we profiled the nonsynonymous genomic variation in 158 genes causally implicated in carcinogenesis using high-quality whole genome sequences from an ancestrally diverse cohort of 681 healthy individuals. We found that all individuals carry multiple variants that may impact cancer susceptibility, with an average of 68 variants per individual. Of the 2,688 allelic variants identified within the cohort, most are very rare, with 75% found in only 1 or 2 individuals in our population. Allele frequencies vary between ancestral groups, and there are 21 variants for which the minor allele in one population is the major allele in another. Detailed analysis of a selected subset of 5 clinically important cancer genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, KRAS, TP53, and PTEN, highlights differences between germline variants and reported somatic mutations. The dataset can serve a resource of genetic variation in cancer-susceptibility genes in 6 ancestry groups, an important foundation for the interpretation of cancer risk from personal genome sequences.

A novel HER2-positive breast cancer phenotype arising from germline TP53 mutations
Introduction:
        
      
      The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is caused by a germline TP53 mutation and is associated with a high risk of breast cancer at young ages. Basal (triple negative) breast cancers are now well recognised to be a typical sub-type of breast cancer developing in a large proportion of BRCA1 gene carriers. We considered whether a similar narrow sub-type of breast cancer was found in TP53 gene mutation carriers.

RNA splicing. The human splicing code reveals new insights into the genetic determinants of disease
To facilitate precision medicine and whole-genome annotation, we developed a machine-learning technique that scores how strongly genetic variants affect RNA splicing, whose alteration contributes to many diseases. Analysis of more than 650,000 intronic and exonic variants revealed widespread patterns of mutation-driven aberrant splicing. Intronic disease mutations that are more than 30 nucleotides from any splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common variants, and missense exonic disease mutations that have the least impact on protein function are five times as likely as others to alter splicing. We detected tens of thousands of disease-causing mutations, including those involved in cancers and spinal muscular atrophy. Examination of intronic and exonic variants found using whole-genome sequencing of individuals with autism revealed misspliced genes with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our approach provides evidence for causal variants and should enable new discoveries in precision medicine.

High prevalence of cancer-associated TP53 variants in the gnomAD database: A word of caution concerning the use of variant filtering
The 1,000 genome project, the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) or the Genome Aggregation database (gnomAD) datasets, were developed to provide large-scale reference data of genetic variations for various populations to filter out common benign variants and identify rare variants of clinical importance based on their frequency in the human population. Using a TP53 repository of 80,000 cancer variants, as well as TP53 variants from multiple cancer genome projects, we have defined a set of certified oncogenic TP53 variants. This specific set has been independently validated by functional and in silico predictive analysis. Here we show that a significant number of these variants are included in gnomAD and ExAC. Most of them correspond to TP53 hotspot variants occurring as somatic and germline events in human cancer. Similarly, disease-associated variants for five other tumor suppressor genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, APC, PTEN, and MLH1, have also been identified. This study demonstrates that germline TP53 variants in the human population are more frequent than previously thought. Furthermore, population databases such as gnomAD or ExAC must be used with caution and need to be annotated for the presence of oncogenic variants to improve their clinical utility.

TP53 variants of uncertain significance: increasing challenges in variant interpretation and genetic counseling
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and Li-Fraumeni Like (LFL) are autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndromes caused by pathogenic germline variants in the TP53 gene. Recent studies have shown that the incorporation of next-generation sequencing by using multigene panels in clinical practice has resulted in the frequent identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Given that there is no established medical management for VUS carriers, the identification of these variants may cause confusion and anxiety for both patients and practitioners. Herein, we aimed to verify VUS frequency and review VUS classification and interpretation in 1844 patients submitted for comprehensive germline TP53 testing independent of clinical criteria. Variant characterization was done assessing clinical information whenever available, variant frequency in population databases, pathogenicity predictions using in silico tools and previous functional studies. All variants were classified based on the guidelines proposed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (2015) and by the Sherloc framework (2017). Of the twelve VUS (0.65%) identified in TP53, two were classified as likely pathogenic and two were classified as likely benign after re-evaluation, potentially resulting in significant management modification for the proband and relatives. This report cases highlights the challenges and impact of TP53 variant interpretation especially when there is no clear LFS/LFL phenotype.

The codon 47 polymorphism in p53 is functionally significant
In addition to a common polymorphism at codon 72, the p53 tumor suppressor gene also contains a rare single nucleotide polymorphism at amino acid 47. Wild type p53 encodes proline at this residue, but in <5% of African Americans, this amino acid is serine. Notably, phosphorylation of the adjacent serine 46 by the proline-directed kinase p38 MAPK is known to greatly enhance the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis. Here we showed that the serine 47 polymorphic variant, which replaces the proline residue necessary for recognition by proline-directed kinases, is a markedly poorer substrate for phosphorylation on serine 46 by p38 MAPK. Consistent with this finding, we showed that the serine 47 variant has up to 5-fold decreased ability to induce apoptosis compared with wild type p53. Mechanistically, we found that this variant has decreased ability to transactivate two p53 target genes, p53AIP1 and PUMA, but not other p53 response genes; this is the first time that phosphorylation of serine 46 has been implicated in transactivation of PUMA by p53. Down-regulation of PUMA in cells with wild type p53 using short interfering RNAs reduced apoptosis in these cells to a level comparable to that in cells containing the serine 47 variant. The combined data indicated that, like the codon 72 polymorphism, the codon 47 polymorphism of p53 is functionally significant and may play a role in cancer risk, progression, and the efficacy of therapy.

Understanding the function-structure and function-mutation relationships of p53 tumor suppressor protein by high-resolution missense mutation analysis
Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 by missense mutations is the most frequent genetic alteration in human cancers. The common missense mutations in the TP53 gene disrupt the ability of p53 to bind to DNA and consequently to transactivate downstream genes. However, it is still not fully understood how a large number of the remaining mutations affect p53 structure and function. Here, we used a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis technique and a yeast-based functional assay to construct, express, and evaluate 2,314 p53 mutants representing all possible amino acid substitutions caused by a point mutation throughout the protein (5.9 substitutions per residue), and correlated p53 function with structure- and tumor-derived mutations. This high-resolution mutation analysis allows evaluation of previous predictions and hypotheses through interrelation of function, structure and mutation.

p53 polymorphisms: cancer implications
The normal functioning of p53 is a potent barrier to cancer. Tumour-associated mutations in TP53, typically single nucleotide substitutions in the coding sequence, are a hallmark of most human cancers and cause dramatic defects in p53 function. By contrast, only a small fraction, if any, of the >200 naturally occurring sequence variations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) of TP53 in human populations are expected to cause measurable perturbation of p53 function. Polymorphisms in the TP53 locus that might have cancer-related phenotypical manifestations are the subject of this Review. Polymorphic variants of other genes in the p53 pathway, such as MDM2, which might have biological consequences either individually or in combination with p53 variants are also discussed.

Prevalence of low-penetrant germline TP53 D49H mutation in Japanese cancer patients
Using whole exome sequencing data obtained from 1,685 Japanese cancer patients, we examined genetic variations of germline TP53 and found 10 types of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants. In the present study, we focused on 6 patients with germline D49H mutation located in the transactivation domain 2 of p53 protein, since the mutation seemed to be prevalent in cancer patients and to be pathogenic. According to the initial survey for family history of the proband with the germline TP53 D49H mutation, one osteosarcoma patient and his pedigree fulfill the criteria for Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome and the 2009 Chompret criteria for germline TP53 mutation screening. Since this patient possesses double germline mutations of TP53 D49H and A159D, further studies are required to evaluate contribution of the D49H mutation in this morbidity. The remaining 5 patients had family histories of cancer, but none fulfills the criteria either for the Li-Fraumeni/Li-Fraumeni-like syndromes or the 2009 Chompret criteria for germline TP53 mutation screening. It is possible to postulate that the germline TP53 D49H mutation is likely to be low-penetrant in some pedigrees. The present study also indicates that the survey for the germline TP53 mutation plays an important role in clinical practice as it will prevent mistaking cancer patients with unusual heredities for sporadic cases.

Nodular Lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma in a 15-Year-Old Boy With Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Having a Germline TP53 D49H Mutation
Germline mutations in TP53 are the primary cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Most mutations are reported within the DNA-binding domain. We report a case of a 15-year-old boy with LFS who developed early-stage nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare subtype of Hodgkin lymphomas. His sister was diagnosed with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma at the age of 1.5 years. Sequence analysis revealed a germline mutation in the transactivation domain of TP53, c.145G>C (p.D49H), in the patient, his sister, and father. One family with LFS with a germline TP53 D49H mutation has previously been reported. This report supports the pathogenicity of this mutation.

Early-onset of sporadic basal-cell carcinoma: germline mutations in the TP53, PTCH, and XPD genes
Background:
        
      
      Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common non-melanoma skin cancer in the Western world. The objective of this study was to examine together germline mutations in the TP53, PTCH, and XPD genes as risk factors for developing BCC at a young age. We hypothesized that mutations in these genes significantly increase the risk of early-onset BCC (< or = 35 years).

Germline mutations in young non-smoking women with lung adenocarcinoma
Objectives:
        
      
      Although the primary cause of lung cancer is smoking, a considerable proportion of all lung cancers occur in never smokers. Gender influences the risk and characteristics of lung cancer and women are overrepresented among never smokers with the disease. Young age at onset and lack of established environmental risk factors suggest genetic predisposition. In this study, we used population-based sampling of young patients to discover candidate predisposition variants for lung adenocarcinoma in never-smoking women.

Spectrum of germline cancer susceptibility gene mutations in Turkish colorectal cancer patients: a single center study
Background/aim:
        
      
      Quarter of colorectal cancer patients have a family history and 6% of these comprise hereditary cancer syndromes. For developing national health strategies for genetic screening, it is crucial to determine the spectrum of damaging alterations in causative genes and to describe frequent founder mutations.

Germline mutations in 40 cancer susceptibility genes among Chinese patients with high hereditary risk breast cancer
Multigene panel testing of breast cancer predisposition genes have been extensively conducted in Europe and America, which is relatively rare in Asia however. In this study, we assessed the frequency of germline mutations in 40 cancer predisposition genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, among a large cohort of Chinese patients with high hereditary risk of BC. From 2015 to 2016, consecutive BC patients from 26 centers of China with high hereditary risk were recruited (n = 937). Clinical information was collected and next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using blood samples of participants to identify germline mutations. In total, we acquired 223 patients with putative germline mutations, including 159 in BRCA1/2, 61 in 15 other BC susceptibility genes and 3 in both BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA1/2 gene. Major mutant non-BRCA1/2 genes were TP53 (n = 18), PALB2 (n = 11), CHEK2 (n = 6), ATM (n = 6) and BARD1 (n = 5). No factors predicted pathologic mutations in non-BRCA1/2 genes when treated as a whole. TP53 mutations were associated with HER-2 positive BC and younger age at diagnosis; and CHEK2 and PALB2 mutations were enriched in patients with luminal BC. Among high hereditary risk Chinese BC patients, 23.8% contained germline mutations, including 6.8% in non-BRCA1/2 genes. TP53 and PALB2 had a relatively high mutation rate (1.9 and 1.2%). Although no factors predicted for detrimental mutations in non-BRCA1/2 genes, some clinical features were associated with mutations of several particular genes.

Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations
Background:
        
      
      Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women with TP53 mutations is limited.

High Prevalence of Hereditary Cancer Syndromes and Outcomes in Adults with Early-Onset Pancreatic Cancer
Introduction: We aimed to determine the prevalence and landscape of germline mutations among patients with young-onset pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) as well as their influence in prognosis.Methods: Patients from two cohorts were studied, the high-risk cohort (HRC), which included 584 PDAC patients who received genetic counseling at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and a general cohort (GC) with 233 metastatic PDAC patients. We defined germline DNA sequencing on 13 known pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes. The prevalence and landscape of mutations were determined, and clinical characteristics including survival were analyzed.Results: A total of 409 patients underwent genetic testing (277 from HRC and 132 from GC). As expected, the HRC had higher prevalence of germline mutations compared with the GC: 17.3% versus 6.81%. The most common mutations in both cohorts were in BRCA1/2 and mismatch-repair (MMR) genes. Patients younger than 60 years old had significantly higher prevalence of germline mutations in both the HRC [odds ratios (OR), 1.93 Â± 1.03-3.70, P = 0.039] and GC (4.78 Â± 1.10-32.95, P = 0.036). Furthermore, PDAC patients with germline mutations in the GC had better overall survival than patients without mutations (HR, 0.44; 95% CI of HR, 0.25-0.76, P = 0.030).Discussion: Germline mutations are highly prevalent in patients with PDAC of early onset and can be predictive of better outcomes. Considering emerging screening strategies for relatives carrying susceptibility genes as well as impact on therapy choices, genetic counseling and testing should be encouraged in PDAC patients, particularly those of young onset.

Hematologic malignancies and Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with a high risk of a broad range of childhood- and adult-onset cancers. LFS is related to germline mutations of the tumor-suppressor gene TP53 The most common reported leukemia associated with LFS is hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but myeloid malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are also reported, often in the setting of therapy-related disease. We reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics including cytogenetics and molecular analysis for seven adult patients with LFS and hematologic malignancies evaluated at the Hereditary Hematologic Malignancy Clinic (HHMC) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. We present this LFS review series to increase awareness of LFS for the appropriate diagnosis of both patients and potentially affected relatives, as well as provide experience with patient outcomes in this difficult to treat population.

Analysis of a germ line polymorphism of the p53 gene in lung cancer patients; discrete results with smoking history
The p53 tumor suppressor gene is often mutated in various human cancers and a common polymorphism is known at codon 72 of exon 4, with two alleles encoding either arginine (CGC) or proline (CCC). Association of this polymorphism with any human cancer susceptibility has yet to be clarified. We have conducted a case-control study in Japan on the distribution of the three genotypes with 191 lung cancer patients, 152 control patients with non-cancerous pulmonary diseases and 115 colorectal cancer patients. The genotypes were examined by PCR using DNA samples from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Frequency distributions of the three genotypes were quite comparable with each other among groups, with allelic frequencies of approximately 60% for arginine and 40% for proline. The genotypic frequencies in lung cancer patients, however, were largely different between smokers and non-smokers (chi 2 = 13.5, df = 2, P < 0.001). Compared with the control and colorectal cancer patients a significant difference in genotypic frequency was observed only in non-smoker lung cancers (chi 2 = 10.9, df = 2, P < 0.01), with an excess of Arg/Arg homozygotes and a deficit of Arg/Pro heterozygotes. Our present data suggest that the p53 polymorphism affects the risk of lung cancer unrelated to smoking.

Role of a p53 polymorphism in the development of human papillomavirus-associated cancer
The E6 oncoprotein derived from tumour-associated human papillomaviruses (HPVs) binds to and induces the degradation of the cellular tumour-suppressor protein p53. A common polymorphism that occurs in the p53 amino-acid sequence results in the presence of either a proline or an arginine at position 72. The effect of this polymorphism on the susceptibility of p53 to E6-mediated degradation has been investigated and the arginine form of p53 was found to be significantly more susceptible than the proline form. Moreover, allelic analysis of patients with HPV-associated tumours revealed a striking overrepresentation of homozygous arginine-72 p53 compared with the normal population, which indicated that individuals homozygous for arginine 72 are about seven times more susceptible to HPV-associated tumorigenesis than heterozygotes. The arginine-encoding allele therefore represents a significant risk factor in the development of HPV-associated cancers.

Two polymorphic variants of wild-type p53 differ biochemically and biologically
The wild-type p53 protein exhibits a common polymorphism at amino acid 72, resulting in either a proline residue (p53Pro) or an arginine residue (p53Arg) at this position. Despite the difference that this change makes in the primary structure of the protein resulting in a difference in migration during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, no differences in the biochemical or biological characteristics of these wild-type p53 variants have been reported. We have recently shown that p53Arg is significantly more susceptible than p53Pro to the degradation induced by human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein. Moreover, this may result in an increased susceptibility to HPV-induced tumors in homozygous p53Arg individuals. In further investigating the characteristics of these p53 variants, we now show that both forms are morphologically wild type and do not differ in their ability to bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. However, there are a number of differences between the p53 variants in their abilities to bind components of the transcriptional machinery, to activate transcription, to induce apoptosis, and to repress the transformation of primary cells. These observations may have implications for the development of cancers which harbor wild-type p53 sequences and possibly for the ability of such tumors to respond to therapy, depending on their p53 genotype.

A novel p53 germline alteration identified in a late onset breast cancer kindred
Germline mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are associated with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by childhood sarcoma, leukemia and early onset breast cancer and has occasionally been found also in familial breast-ovarian cancer. Most mutations found are of missense type and located in the central region of the gene (exons 5 to 8). In the present study, a germline p53 alteration was identified in a late onset breast cancer family (kindred Lund 5; mean age 58 years) using single stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. The mutation (a CCG to CTG transition) at codon 82 in exon 4, resulting in a proline to leucine substitution, has not previously been reported and was not present in a control set of 60 healthy individuals. Three of five woman with breast cancer (45, 57 and 65 years) were carriers of the alteration. Loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus was not seen in the primary tumors of these women, but appeared as a partial loss of the wildtype allele in subsequent recurrent lesions of two gene carriers. The family manifested no linkage to the p53 gene (a two-point LOD-score of -0.41), and has previously also been excluded for linkage to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci, as well as being carrier of a BRCA1 germline mutation. Although it seems unlikely that the p53 germline mutation is the major cause of disease predisposition in Lund 5, the data suggest that some p53 alteration may confer a subtle influence on breast cancer development and progression.

Transcriptional functionality of germ line p53 mutants influences cancer phenotype
Purpose:
        
      
      The TP53 tumor suppressor gene encodes a sequence-specific transcription factor that is able to transactivate several sets of genes, the promoters of which include appropriate response elements. Although human cancers frequently contain mutated p53, the alleles as well as the clinical expression are often heterogeneous. Germ line mutations of TP53 result in cancer proneness syndromes known as Li-Fraumeni, Li-Fraumeni--like, and nonsyndromic predisposition with or without family history. p53 mutants can be classified as partial deficiency alleles or severe deficiency alleles depending on their ability to transactivate a set of human target sequences, as measured using a standardized yeast-based assay (see http://www.umd.be:2072/index.html). We have investigated the extent to which the functional features of p53 mutant alleles determine clinical features in patients who have inherited these alleles and have developed cancer.

Analysis of the DNA-binding activity of p53 mutants using functional protein microarrays and its relationship to transcriptional activation
Sequence-specific DNA binding is the key function through which tumor suppressor p53 exerts transactivation of the downstream target genes, often being impaired in cancer cells by mutations in the TP53 gene. Functional protein microarray technology enables a high-throughput parallel analysis of protein properties within one experiment under the same conditions. Using an array approach, we analyzed the DNA binding activity of wild type p53 protein and of 49 variants. Our results show significant differences in the binding properties between the p53 mutants. The C-terminal mutant R337C displayed the highest DNA binding activity on the array. However, the same mutant showed only a partial activation in the reporter gene assay and almost no activation of downstream target genes after transfection of expression vector into cells lacking endogenous p53. These observations demonstrate that DNA binding itself is not sufficient for activating the p53 target genes in at least some of the p53 mutants and, therefore, in vitro studies might not always reflect in vivo conditions.

Frequency of pathogenic germline variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2 and TP53 in ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed in women under the age of 50 years
Introduction:
        
      
      Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor of invasive ductal breast cancer, and approximately 20% of screen-detected tumours are pure DCIS. Most risk factors for breast cancer have similar associations with DCIS and IDC; however, there is limited data on the prevalence of the known high and moderate penetrance breast cancer predisposition genes in DCIS and which women with DCIS should be referred for genetic screening. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of germline variants in BRCA2, BRCA1, CHEK2, PALB2 and TP53 in DCIS in women aged less than 50 years of age.

Harmonizing Clinical Sequencing and Interpretation for the eMERGE III Network
The advancement of precision medicine requires new methods to coordinate and deliver genetic data from heterogeneous sources to physicians and patients. The eMERGE III Network enrolled >25,000 participants from biobank and prospective cohorts of predominantly healthy individuals for clinical genetic testing to determine clinically actionable findings. The network developed protocols linking together the 11 participant collection sites and 2 clinical genetic testing laboratories. DNA capture panels targeting 109 genes were used for testing of DNA and sample collection, data generation, interpretation, reporting, delivery, and storage were each harmonized. A compliant and secure network enabled ongoing review and reconciliation of clinical interpretations, while maintaining communication and data sharing between clinicians and investigators. A total of 202 individuals had positive diagnostic findings relevant to the indication for testing and 1,294 had additional/secondary findings of medical significance deemed to be returnable, establishing data return rates for other testing endeavors. This study accomplished integration of structured genomic results into multiple electronic health record (EHR) systems, setting the stage for clinical decision support to enable genomic medicine. Further, the established processes enable different sequencing sites to harmonize technical and interpretive aspects of sequencing tests, a critical achievement toward global standardization of genomic testing. The eMERGE protocols and tools are available for widespread dissemination.

BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 mutations in very early-onset breast cancer with associated risks to relatives
Pathological mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This study evaluated mutation frequency of these genes in early-onset breast cancer patients, and correlated this with family history and determined relative risks to family members. Patients with breast adenocarcinoma diagnosed 30 years were ascertained between 1980 and 1997. Family history was established and mutation screening of BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 genes was performed. Estimates of penetrance and relative risk were undertaken. DNA was obtained from 100/139 women. 17/36 familial cases had a BRCA1, BRCA2 or TP53 mutation. Of 64 non-familial cases, one BRCA2, two BRCA1 and two TP53 mutations were detected. Penetrance estimates (by age 70) for breast cancer were 84% for BRCA1 mutations and 91% for BRCA2 mutations and for ovarian cancer, 60% and 26%, respectively. Relative risks associated with mutations were consistent with previous studies. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in patients with breast cancer 30 years are predicted strongly by family history. The majority of families with ovarian cancer were due to mutations in BRCA1/2 whereas these mutations only accounted for 30-50% of the excess breast cancers.

Novel germline mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1, BRCA2 and p53 gene in breast cancer patients from India
Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for more than 80% of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. p53 tumor suppressor gene that controls cellular growth and differentiation is also known to be mutated in more than 50% of human cancers including breast cancer. We have carried out a study on BRCA1 and BRCA2 along with p53 gene mutations in both sporadic as well as familial breast cancer patients from India where breast cancer is fast emerging as a major cancer among premenopausal urban women. We examined 124 untreated primary breast cancer patients comprising 100 sporadic and 24 familial cases including 56 age-matched healthy controls for the presence of BRCA1, BRCA2 and the p53 gene mutations using PCR-SSCP and direct nucleotide sequencing. Certain frequently mutated exons such as 2, 5, 11, 13 and 20 of BRCA1, exons 2, 9, 11 (for 6174delT), 18 and 20 of BRCA2 and 4-9 exons of p53 gene were analyzed in sporadic breast cancer while all 22 coding exons of BRCA1 including its flanking intronic regions along with above mentioned exons of BRCA2 and p53 gene were analyzed in familial breast cancer patients. We identified six patients (25%) with BRCA1 mutation of which three were found to be of novel type one in exon 16 (4956insG) and two in exon 7 (Lys110Thr) (Ser114Pro) out of 24 familial breast cancer patients studied from two different geographic regions/populations of India. Two sisters from a single family (12.5%) out of eight families from Goa with Portuguese colonial origin showed presence of founder Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 mutation (185delAG) along with (IVS7 561-34T>C; IVS18 5271 + 66G > A). While from New Delhi, four (25%) of 16 breast cancer families showed BRCA1 mutations; a frame shift protein truncating (4956insG), a transition nonsense (Gln1395Stop) and two amino acid substitutions (Lys110Thr) and (Ser114Pro). Only one (4%) p53 mutation (Val97Ile) in its exon 4 along with BRCA1 mutation (4956insG) could be detected. No major sequence variation in BRCA2 gene was observed except for G203A at 5' UTR of exon 2, a common population polymorphism in two Goan patients who also showed silent nucleotide change for amino acid serine at codon 1436 of BRCA1 gene. None of the 100 sporadic breast cancer patients revealed any protein truncating or deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. Interestingly, three (3%) p53 mutations in its exon 5 were detected in sporadic breast cancer patients. Although three novel BRCA1 mutations including a founder Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 mutation were recorded in Indian women with familial breast cancer, the overall prevalence of BRCA gene mutations in Indian women with a family history of breast cancer appears to be low.

Dominant-negative features of mutant TP53 in germline carriers have limited impact on cancer outcomes
Germline TP53 mutations result in cancer proneness syndromes known as Li-Fraumeni, Li-Fraumeni-like, and nonsyndromic predisposition with or without family history. To explore genotype/phenotype associations, we previously adopted a functional classification of all germline TP53 mutant alleles based on transactivation. Severe deficiency (SD) alleles were associated with more severe cancer proneness syndromes, and a larger number of tumors, compared with partial deficiency (PD) alleles. Because mutant p53 can exert dominant-negative (DN) effects, we addressed the relationship between DN and clinical manifestations. We reasoned that DN effects might be stronger in familial cancer cases associated with germline TP53 mutations, where mutant alleles coexist with the wild-type allele since conception. We examined 104 p53 mutant alleles with single amino acid substitutions described in the IARC germline database for (i) transactivation capability and (ii) capacity to reduce the activity of the wild-type allele (i.e., DN effect) using a quantitative yeast-based assay. The functional classifications of p53 alleles were then related to clinical variables. We confirmed that a classification based on transactivation alone can identify familial cancer cases with more severe clinical features. Classification based on DN effects allowed us to highlight similar associations but did not reveal distinct clinical subclasses of SD alleles, except for a correlation with tumor tissue prevalence. We conclude that in carriers of germline TP53 mutations transactivation-based classification of TP53 alleles appears more important for genotype/phenotype correlations than DN effects and that haplo-insufficiency of the TP53 gene is an important factor in cancer proneness in humans.

Germline TP53 variants and susceptibility to osteosarcoma
The etiologic contribution of germline genetic variation to sporadic osteosarcoma is not well understood. Osteosarcoma is a sentinel cancer of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), in which approximately 70% of families meeting the classic criteria have germline TP53 mutations. We sequenced TP53 exons in 765 osteosarcoma cases. Data were analyzed with Ï(2) tests, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards regression models. We observed a high frequency of young osteosarcoma cases (age <30 years) carrying a known LFS- or likely LFS-associated mutation (3.8%) or rare exonic variant (5.7%) with an overall frequency of 9.5%, compared with none in case patients age 30 years and older (P < .001). This high TP53 mutation prevalence in young osteosarcoma cases is statistically significantly greater than the previously reported prevalence of 3% (P = .0024). We identified a novel association between a TP53 rare variant and metastasis at diagnosis of osteosarcoma (rs1800372, odds ratio = 4.27, 95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 15.5, P = .026). Genetic susceptibility to young onset osteosarcoma is distinct from older adult onset osteosarcoma, with a high frequency of LFS-associated and rare exonic TP53 variants.

Germline mutations of TP53 and BRCA2 genes in breast cancer/sarcoma families
The genetic aetiology of familial aggregations of breast cancer and sarcomas has been elucidated only in part. In this study, 23 unrelated individuals from families with one case of sarcoma and at least one case of breast cancer were screened for mutations in the TP53, BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Families were classified according to their conformity to the criteria defining the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome and hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC). Germline TP53 mutations were identified in three instances (13%), including one LFS and two LFL families, while none of the non-LFS/non-LFL families had a TP53 mutation. Three cases (13%), including one with a TP53 mutation, carried BRCA2 mutations. Of these, two were observed in LFL/HBOC families and the other one in a non-LFS/non-LFL/HBOC family, while none of the non-HBOC families tested positive. These findings suggest that the screening of BRCA2, in addition to TP53, may be appropriate for the molecular characterisation of breast cancer/sarcoma families, with practical implications for counselling and clinical management.

Contribution of de novo and mosaic TP53 mutations to Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Background:
        
      
      Development of tumours such as adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), choroid plexus tumours (CPT) or female breast cancers before age 31 or multiple primary cancers belonging to the Li-Fraumeni (LFS) spectrum is, independently of the familial history, highly suggestive of a germline TP53 mutation. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of de novo and mosaic mutations to LFS.

Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variant prevalence among the first 10,000 patients referred for next-generation cancer panel testing
Purpose:
        
      
      Germ-line testing for panels of cancer genes using next-generation sequencing is becoming more common in clinical care. We report our experience as a clinical laboratory testing both well-established, high-risk cancer genes (e.g., BRCA1/2, MLH1, MSH2) as well as more recently identified cancer genes (e.g., PALB2, BRIP1), many of which have increased but less well-defined penetrance.

Identification of novel TP53 mutations in familial and sporadic cancer cases of German and Swiss origin
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare cancer syndrome caused by mutations in the TP53 gene. A number of tumor-associated germline mutations have been described in individuals from various ethnic origins although, thus far, none in affected individuals of German descent. Our work aimed to detect germline mutations in the TP53 gene in five index cases of German and Swiss origin with cancers typical of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. We analyzed all ten coding exons of the TP53 gene by direct sequencing of PCR products. We identified five mutations of which three were found in families with a strong history of LFS in several generations while two likely came about de novo. The five mutations include two missense mutations in exon 4 (Gly105Cys) and exon 7 (Arg248Gln), one deletion of 11 base pairs encompassing the splice acceptor sequence of exon 6 (IVS5-11_-1 del), one nonsense mutation in exon 6 (Arg196Stop), and one duplication of 4 base pairs in exon 8 (1020_1023dupCTGC). The functional consequence of the IVS5-11_-1del mutation on splicing of pre-mRNA was investigated by an in vitro assay. Our study reports the first germline mutations in patients of German and Swiss origin with LFS-related tumors. The frequent identification of de novo germline mutations emphasizes the importance of mutational analyses of the TP53 gene particularly in young patients with malignancies typical for LFS, but without a positive family history of this tumor syndrome.

Screening of over 1000 Indian patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer with a multi-gene panel: prevalence of BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA mutations
Purpose:
        
      
      Breast and/or ovarian cancers are among the most common cancers in women across the world. In the Indian population, the healthcare burden of breast and/or ovarian cancers has been steadily rising, thus stressing the need for early detection, surveillance, and disease management measures. However, the burden attributable to inherited mutations is not well characterized.

Germline p53 mutation in a patient with multiple primary cancers
We report a case of multiple primary cancers having a germline missense mutation of the p53 gene. The patient was a Japanese female and had a history of five different types of cancers. PCR/direct sequencing analysis revealed the presence of a nucleotide substitution, AGC (Ser) to AGG (Arg), at codon 106 of the p53 gene in DNA from non-cancerous breast tissue. This is the first case of germline p53 mutation at codon 106, and could contribute to establishing correlations between the types and locations of germline p53 mutations and their phenotypical consequences.

Germline Mutations in Predisposition Genes in Pediatric Cancer
Background:
        
      
      The prevalence and spectrum of predisposing mutations among children and adolescents with cancer are largely unknown. Knowledge of such mutations may improve the understanding of tumorigenesis, direct patient care, and enable genetic counseling of patients and families.

Variable population prevalence estimates of germline TP53 variants: A gnomAD-based analysis
Reports of variable cancer penetrance in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) have raised questions regarding the prevalence of pathogenic germline TP53 variants. We previously reported higher-than-expected population prevalence estimates in sequencing databases composed of individuals unselected for cancer history. This study aimed to expand and further evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic and likely pathogenic germline TP53 variants in the gnomAD dataset (version r2.0.2, n = 138,632). Variants were selected and classified based on our previously published algorithm and compared with alternative estimates based on three different classification databases: ClinVar, HGMD, and the UMD_TP53 database. Conservative prevalence estimates of pathogenic and likely pathogenic TP53 variants were within the range of one carrier in 3,555-5,476 individuals. Less stringent classification increased the approximate prevalence to one carrier in every 400-865 individuals, mainly due to the inclusion of the controvertible p.N235S, p.V31I, and p.R290H variants. This study shows a higher-than-expected population prevalence of pathogenic and likely pathogenic germline TP53 variants even with the most conservative estimates. However, these estimates may not necessarily reflect the prevalence of the classical LFS phenotype, which is based upon family history of cancer. Comprehensive approaches are needed to better understand the interplay of germline TP53 variant classification, prevalence estimates, cancer penetrance, and LFS-associated phenotype.

Personalized genomic analyses for cancer mutation discovery and interpretation
Massively parallel sequencing approaches are beginning to be used clinically to characterize individual patient tumors and to select therapies based on the identified mutations. A major question in these analyses is the extent to which these methods identify clinically actionable alterations and whether the examination of the tumor tissue alone is sufficient or whether matched normal DNA should also be analyzed to accurately identify tumor-specific (somatic) alterations. To address these issues, we comprehensively evaluated 815 tumor-normal paired samples from patients of 15 tumor types. We identified genomic alterations using next-generation sequencing of whole exomes or 111 targeted genes that were validated with sensitivities >95% and >99%, respectively, and specificities >99.99%. These analyses revealed an average of 140 and 4.3 somatic mutations per exome and targeted analysis, respectively. More than 75% of cases had somatic alterations in genes associated with known therapies or current clinical trials. Analyses of matched normal DNA identified germline alterations in cancer-predisposing genes in 3% of patients with apparently sporadic cancers. In contrast, a tumor-only sequencing approach could not definitively identify germline changes in cancer-predisposing genes and led to additional false-positive findings comprising 31% and 65% of alterations identified in targeted and exome analyses, respectively, including in potentially actionable genes. These data suggest that matched tumor-normal sequencing analyses are essential for precise identification and interpretation of somatic and germline alterations and have important implications for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of cancer patients.

Germline pathogenic variant spectrum in 25 cancer susceptibility genes in Turkish breast and colorectal cancer patients and elderly controls
Inherited pathogenic variants account for 5% to 10% of all breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. Here, we sought to profile the pathogenic variants in 25 cancer susceptibility genes in Turkish population. Germline pathogenic variants were screened in 732 BC patients, 189 CRC patients and 490 cancer-free elderly controls, using next-generation sequencing-based multigene panel testing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification testing. Pathogenic variants were detected in 17.2% of high-risk BC patients and 26.4% of high-risk CRC patients. More than 95% of these variants were clinically actionable. BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6) accounted for two-thirds of all pathogenic variants detected in high-risk BC and CRC patients, respectively. Pathogenic variants in PALB2, CHEK2, ATM and TP53 were also prevalent in high-risk BC patients (4.5%). BRCA1 exons 17-18 deletion and CHEK2 c.592+3A>T were the most common variants predisposing to BC, and they are likely to be founder variants. Three frequent MUTYH pathogenic variants (c.884C>T, c.1437_1439delGGA and c.1187G>A) were responsible for all MUTYH biallelic cases (4.4% of high-risk CRC patients). The total pathogenic variant frequency was very low in controls (2.4%) and in low-risk BC (3.9%) and CRC (6.1%) patients. Our study depicts the pathogenic variant spectrum and prevalence in Turkish BC and CRC patients, guiding clinicians and health authorities for genetic testing applications and variant classification in Turkish population.

Germline TP53 mutations result into a constitutive defect of p53 DNA binding and transcriptional response to DNA damage
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) results from heterozygous germline mutations of TP53, encoding a key transcriptional factor activated in response to DNA damage. We have recently shown, from a large LFS series, that dominant-negative missense mutations are the most clinically severe and, thanks to a new p53 functional assay in lymphocytes, that they alter the p53 transcriptional response to DNA damage more drastically than null mutations. In this study, we first confirmed this observation by performing the p53 functional assay in lymphocytes from 56 TP53 mutation carriers harbouring 35 distinct alterations. Then, to compare the impact of the different types of germline TP53 mutations on DNA binding, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in lymphocytes exposed to doxorubicin. ChIP-Seq performed in wild-type TP53 control lymphocytes accurately mapped 1287 p53-binding sites. New p53-binding sites were validated using a functional assay in yeast. ChIP-Seq analysis of LFS lymphocytes carrying TP53 null mutations (p.P152Rfs*18 or complete deletion) or the low penetrant 'Brazilian' p.R337H mutation revealed a moderate decrease of p53-binding sites (949, 580 and 620, respectively) and of ChIP-Seq peak depths. In contrast, analysis of LFS lymphocytes with TP53 dominant-negative missense mutations p.R273H or p.R248W revealed only 310 and 143 p53-binding sites, respectively, and the depths of the corresponding peaks were drastically reduced. Altogether, our results show that TP53 mutation carriers exhibit a constitutive defect of the transcriptional response to DNA damage and that the clinical severity of TP53 dominant-negative missense mutations is explained by a massive and global alteration of p53 DNA binding.

The first two confirmed sub-Saharan African families with germline TP53 mutations causing Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare inherited cancer syndrome characterised by the early onset of specific cancers. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is associated with germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene, TP53. This study reports the first cases of molecularly confirmed LFS germline mutations in sub-Saharan Africa. Three black African patients, all with LFS-associated cancers, were seen through the Clinical and Counselling Section of the Division of Human Genetics at the National Health Laboratory Service and University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, during 2011-2012. All three patients (two were related) were recruited into this research study. Sequence analysis of the coding region of the TP53 gene identified a Class IV (likely pathogenic) variant, c.326T > C (p.Phe109Ser), in the two related patients, and a known pathogenic mutation, c.1010G > A (p.Arg337His), also referred to as the Brazilian founder mutation, in the other patient. A confirmed diagnosis in these patients will assist in tailored medical management (it is recommended that individuals carrying a germline TP53 mutation avoid radiotherapy as this might cause secondary radiotherapy-induced malignancies) and in addition, genetic testing of at-risk family members can be offered. Very little is known and documented on LFS in African individuals. Despite the small number of patients in this study, the results support the need for diagnostic genetic testing for LFS in South Africa.

Germline TP53 and MSH6 mutations implicated in sporadic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC): a preliminary study
Background:
        
      
      Germline BRCA1/2 prevalence is relatively low in sporadic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We hypothesized that non-BRCA genes may also have significant germline contribution to Chinese sporadic TNBC, and the somatic mutational landscape of TNBC may vary between ethnic groups. We therefore conducted this study to investigate germline and somatic mutations in 43 cancer susceptibility genes in Chinese sporadic TNBC.

Functional characterization of novel germline TP53 variants in Swedish families
Pathogenic germline TP53 variants predispose to a wide range of early onset cancers, often recognized as the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). They are also identified in 1% of families with hereditary breast cancer (HrBC) that do not fulfill the criteria for LFS. In this study, we present a total of 24 different TP53 variants identified in 31 Swedish families with LFS or HrBC. Ten of these variants, nine exonic and one splice, have previously not been described as germline pathogenic variants. The nine exonic variants were functionally characterized and demonstrated partial transactivation activity compared to wild-type p53. Some show nuclear localization similar to wild-type p53 while others possess cytoplasmic or perinuclear localization. The four frameshift variants (W91Gfs*32, L111 Wfs*12, S227 Lfs*20 and S240Kfs*25) had negligible, while F134 L and T231del had low level of p53 activity. The L111 Wfs*12 and T231del variants are also deficient for induction of apoptosis. The missense variant R110C retain p53 effects and the nonsense E349* shows at least partial transcription factor activity but has reduced ability to trigger apoptosis. This is the first functional characterization of novel germline TP53 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the Swedish cohort as an attempt to understand its association with LFS and HrBC, respectively.

Prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in HER2+ breast cancer patients
Breast cancer is the most frequent tumor in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare inherited cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 gene. Recent data show that breast cancer in germline TP53 mutation carriers is commonly HER2+ (63-83 %). We assessed the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in a cohort of women with HER2+ breast cancer diagnosed age â¤50 years. We identified blood specimens from 213 women with primary invasive HER2+ breast cancer age â¤50 years from a single center. Exon grouping analysis sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification techniques were used to screen for germline TP53 mutations. Among 213 women with HER2+ breast cancer age â¤50 years, 3 (ages at diagnosis 23, 32, 44 years) were found to carry a TP53 mutation (1.4 %, 95 % CI 0.3-4.1 %). ER/PR status was not uniform. Two TP53 carriers met Chompret criteria for LFS; none met classic LFS criteria. Although two-thirds of breast cancers in women with TP53 mutations are HER2+, we observed a low prevalence of germline TP53 mutations among unselected young women with HER2+ breast cancer. Given the potential clinical impact, consideration of germline TP53 testing should be given to young women with HER2+ breast cancer, especially if family cancer history is notable.

Comprehensive mutational scanning of the p53 coding region by two-dimensional gene scanning
A comprehensive mutational scanning test for the p53 coding region based on multiplex PCR and two-dimensional DNA electrophoresis was designed and evaluated. In a 2-step multiplex PCR, the p53 coding region (exons 2-11) was amplified as a single 8646-bp fragment by long-distance PCR in step one. This fragment served as a template for the subsequent co-amplification of the individual exons in two multiplex groups in step two. The multiplex products were then separated, first on the basis of size in non-denaturant polyacrylamide gels and then on the basis of sequence by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Primers for optimal PCR, melting behavior and 2-D gel distribution were designed using a recently developed computer program. The resulting two-dimensional gene scanning (TDGS) test was evaluated by screening, in a blinded fashion, 29 coded DNA samples from Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients with previously identified germline mutations. All mutations were correctly detected. This assay provides an accurate, cost-effective and non-radioactive method for simultaneous mutational scanning of all p53 coding exons.

Exome sequencing covers >98% of mutations identified on targeted next generation sequencing panels
Background:
        
      
      With the expanded availability of next generation sequencing (NGS)-based clinical genetic tests, clinicians seeking to test patients with Mendelian diseases must weigh the superior coverage of targeted gene panels with the greater number of genes included in whole exome sequencing (WES) when considering their first-tier testing approach. Here, we use an in silico analysis to predict the analytic sensitivity of WES using pathogenic variants identified on targeted NGS panels as a reference.

Gastric cancer in individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Purpose:
        
      
      Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 gene. Although sarcomas, brain tumors, leukemias, breast and adrenal cortical carcinomas are typically recognized as Li-Fraumeni syndrome-associated tumors, the occurrence of gastrointestinal neoplasms has not been fully evaluated. In this analysis, we investigated the frequency and characteristics of gastric cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

High frequency of germline TP53 mutations in a prospective adult-onset sarcoma cohort
Sarcomas are a key feature of Li-Fraumeni and related syndromes (LFS/LFL), associated with germline TP53 mutations. Current penetrance estimates for TP53 mutations are subject to significant ascertainment bias. The International Sarcoma Kindred Study is a clinic-based, prospective cohort of adult-onset sarcoma cases, without regard to family history. The entire cohort was screened for mutations in TP53 using high-resolution melting analysis and Sanger sequencing, and multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification and targeted massively parallel sequencing for copy number changes. Pathogenic TP53 mutations were detected in blood DNA of 20/559 sarcoma probands (3.6%); 17 were germline and 3 appeared to be somatically acquired. Of the germline carriers, one appeared to be mosaic, detectable in the tumor and blood, but not epithelial tissues. Germline mutation carriers were more likely to have multiple cancers (47% vs 15% for non-carriers, P = 3.0Ã10(-3)), and earlier cancer onset (33 vs 48 years, P = 1.19Ã10(-3)). The median survival of mutation carriers following first cancer diagnosis was not significantly different from non-carriers. Only 10/17 (59%) pedigrees met classical or Chompret criteria for LFS. In summary, germline TP53 mutations are not rare in adult patients with sarcoma, with implications for screening, surveillance, treatment and genetic counselling of carriers and family members.

Prevalence of germline pathogenic variants in 22 cancer susceptibility genes in Swedish pediatric cancer patients
Up to 10% of pediatric cancer patients harbor pathogenic germline variants in one or more cancer susceptibility genes. A recent study from the US reported pathogenic variants in 22 out of 60 analyzed autosomal dominant cancer susceptibility genes, implicating 8.5% of pediatric cancer patients. Here we aimed to assess the prevalence of germline pathogenic variants in these 22 genes in a population-based Swedish cohort and to compare the results to those described in other populations. We found pathogenic variants in 10 of the 22 genes covering 3.8% of these patients. The prevalence of TP53 mutations was significantly lower than described in previous studies, which can largely be attributed to differences in tumor diagnosis distributions across the three cohorts. Matched family history for relatives allowed assessment of familial cancer incidence, however, no significant difference in cancer incidence was found in families of children carrying pathogenic variants compared to those who did not.

Prevalence and spectrum of germline mutations of the p53 gene among patients with sarcoma
Background:
        
      
      Recent studies have identified germline mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by a high risk of sarcomas of bone and soft tissue, breast cancer, and other tumors. In this report, we address the possibility that some sporadic sarcomas may be associated with new germline mutations of the p53 gene, which would not be manifested as familial cancer unless the patient survived to reproduce.

Prevalence and clinical impact of TP53 germline mutations in Chinese women with breast cancer
The prevalence and clinical relevance of TP53 germline mutations in a large unselected breast cancer series are largely unknown. Here, we determined TP53 germline mutations in a large cohort of 10,053 unselected breast cancer patients through multigene panel-based next-generation and/or Sanger sequencing assays. We found that 0.5% of patients (50 cases) carried a pathogenic TP53 germline mutation in this large series of 10,053 unselected breast cancer patients, and the prevalence of TP53 germline mutation was 3.8% in very early onset breast cancer (age â¤30 years) in this large cohort. TP53 mutation carriers were significantly more likely to have early onset cancer (p < 0.001) and bilateral breast cancer (p = 0.03), they and were significantly more likely to respond to carboplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to anthracycline- or taxane-based regimen in terms of pathologic complete response (50% vs. 0%, p = 0.006). At the median follow-up of 54 months, TP53 mutation was an independent unfavorable factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS), and overall survival (OS) (RFS, adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-4.33, p = 0.02; DRFS, adjusted HR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.41-5.30, p = 0.003; OS, adjusted HR: 4.60, 95% CI: 2.26-9.41, p < 0.001) in multivariate analyses. Our study suggested that TP53 germline mutations occur more frequently in very early onset unselected breast cancer patients; and TP53 germline mutation carriers have a very poor survival and may benefit from carboplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in unselected breast cancer patients.

Childhood adrenocortical carcinoma as a sentinel cancer for detecting families with germline TP53 mutations
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant disorder where affected individuals carry a 50% risk of developing cancer before 30 years of age. It is most commonly associated with mutations in the tumour suppressor gene, TP53. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a very rare paediatric cancer, and up to 80% of affected children are found to carry germline TP53 mutations. Hence, we propose using childhood ACC incidence as selection criteria for referral for TP53 mutation testing, independent of familial cancer history. Under the auspices of the Malaysian Society of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, four eligible children diagnosed with ACC over a 30-month study period were referred for mutation testing. Three had a germline TP53 mutation. Subsequent TP53 testing in relatives showed two inherited mutations and one de novo mutation. These findings strongly support paediatric ACC as a useful sentinel cancer for initiating a germline TP53/LFS detection programme, particularly in countries where the lack of structured oncogenetic practice precludes the identification of families with LFS features.

Genetic diagnosis of familial breast cancer using clonal sequencing
Using conventional Sanger sequencing as a reference standard, we compared the sensitivity, specificity, and capacity of the Illumina GA II platform for the detection of TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 mutations in established tumor cell lines and DNA from patients with germline mutations. A total of 656 coding variants were identified in four cell lines and 65 patient DNAs. All of the known pathogenic mutations (including point mutations and insertions/deletions of up to 16 nucleotides) were identified, using a combination of the Illumina data analysis pipeline with custom and commercial sequence alignment software. In our configuration, clonal sequencing outperforms current diagnostic methods, providing a reduction in analysis times and in reagent costs compared with conventional sequencing. These improvements open the possibility of BRCA1/2 testing for a wider spectrum of at-risk women, and will allow the genetic classification of tumors prior to the use of novel PARP inhibitors to treat BRCA-deficient breast cancers.

Spectrum and prevalence of genetic predisposition in medulloblastoma: a retrospective genetic study and prospective validation in a clinical trial cohort
Background:
        
      
      Medulloblastoma is associated with rare hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes; however, consensus medulloblastoma predisposition genes have not been defined and screening guidelines for genetic counselling and testing for paediatric patients are not available. We aimed to assess and define these genes to provide evidence for future screening guidelines.

Mutations in 12 genes for inherited ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinoma identified by massively parallel sequencing
Inherited loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and other tumor suppressor genes predispose to ovarian carcinomas, but the overall burden of disease due to inherited mutations is not known. Using targeted capture and massively parallel genomic sequencing, we screened for germ-line mutations in 21 tumor suppressor genes in genomic DNA from women with primary ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma. Subjects were consecutively enrolled at diagnosis and not selected for age or family history. All classes of mutations, including point mutations and large genomic deletions and insertions, were detected. Of 360 subjects, 24% carried germ-line loss-of-function mutations: 18% in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and 6% in BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK2, MRE11A, MSH6, NBN, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51C, or TP53. Six of these genes were not previously implicated in inherited ovarian carcinoma. Primary carcinomas were generally characterized by genomic loss of normal alleles of the mutant genes. Of women with inherited mutations, >30% had no family history of breast or ovarian carcinoma, and >35% were 60 y or older at diagnosis. More patients with ovarian carcinoma carry cancer-predisposing mutations and in more genes than previously appreciated. Comprehensive genetic testing for inherited carcinoma is warranted for all women with ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma, regardless of age or family history. Clinical genetic testing is currently done gene by gene, with each test costing thousands of dollars. In contrast, massively parallel sequencing allows such testing for many genes simultaneously at low cost.

Genome sequencing of SHH medulloblastoma predicts genotype-related response to smoothened inhibition
Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors recently entered clinical trials for sonic-hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma (SHH-MB). Clinical response is highly variable. To understand the mechanism(s) of primary resistance and identify pathways cooperating with aberrant SHH signaling, we sequenced and profiled a large cohort of SHH-MBs (n = 133). SHH pathway mutations involved PTCH1 (across all age groups), SUFU (infants, including germline), and SMO (adults). Children >3 years old harbored an excess of downstream MYCN and GLI2 amplifications and frequent TP53 mutations, often in the germline, all of which were rare in infants and adults. Functional assays in different SHH-MB xenograft models demonstrated that SHH-MBs harboring a PTCH1 mutation were responsive to SMO inhibition, whereas tumors harboring an SUFU mutation or MYCN amplification were primarily resistant.

The genomic landscape of hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia
The genetic basis of hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a subtype of ALL characterized by aneuploidy and poor outcome, is unknown. Genomic profiling of 124 hypodiploid ALL cases, including whole-genome and exome sequencing of 40 cases, identified two subtypes that differ in the severity of aneuploidy, transcriptional profiles and submicroscopic genetic alterations. Near-haploid ALL with 24-31 chromosomes harbor alterations targeting receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and Ras signaling (71%) and the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF3 (encoding AIOLOS; 13%). In contrast, low-hypodiploid ALL with 32-39 chromosomes are characterized by alterations in TP53 (91.2%) that are commonly present in nontumor cells, IKZF2 (encoding HELIOS; 53%) and RB1 (41%). Both near-haploid and low-hypodiploid leukemic cells show activation of Ras-signaling and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-signaling pathways and are sensitive to PI3K inhibitors, indicating that these drugs should be explored as a new therapeutic strategy for this aggressive form of leukemia.

TP53 germline mutations in Portugal and genetic modifiers of age at cancer onset
The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease caused by TP53 germline mutations. This study aimed to characterize the TP53 mutational spectrum in patients suspected to have LFS in Portugal and to evaluate the influence of the MDM2-SNP309 and TP53-72Arg variants and of telomere length on age of tumor onset. Probands were primarily selected using the classical LFS criteria (two cases) or the more sensitive Chompret Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) criteria (13 cases), but 12 additional patients that did not comply with those LFS or LFL criteria were included in the analysis based on clinical suspicion (LFS suspects). Nine of the 27 probands (33.3%) presented germline TP53 mutations, two of them occurring de novo and two of them being novel. Three of the nine TP53 mutations were found in families that did not comply with any of the commonly used criteria for TP53 testing, leaving room to recommend the use of less stringent criteria. An association was found between the presence of the TP53-72Arg (but not the MDM2-SNP309) variant and earlier age of onset in TP53 carriers. A negative correlation between telomere length and age of cancer onset was found in patients with germline TP53 mutation, whereas no such correlation was found in controls or in patients with wild-type TP53.

Increased oxidative metabolism in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome
There is growing evidence that alterations in metabolism may contribute to tumorigenesis. Here, we report on members of families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome who carry germline mutations in TP53, the gene encoding the tumor-suppressor protein p53. As compared with family members who are not carriers and with healthy volunteers, family members with these mutations have increased oxidative phosphorylation of skeletal muscle. Basic experimental studies of tissue samples from patients with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome and a mouse model of the syndrome support this in vivo finding of increased mitochondrial function. These results suggest that p53 regulates bioenergetic homeostasis in humans.

A novel TP53 germline mutation in a family with a history of multiple malignancies: case report and review of the literature
Objective:
        
      
      Choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) has been associated with TP53 germline mutations and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). We describe our finding of a novel germline mutation in the TP53 gene in a family with multiple malignancies and in association with a child presenting with CPC.

Inherited breast cancer predisposition in Asians: multigene panel testing outcomes from Singapore
Genetic testing for germline mutations in breast cancer predisposition genes can potentially identify individuals at a high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. There is a paucity of such mutational information for Asians. Panel testing of 25 cancer susceptibility genes and BRCA1/2 deletion/duplication analysis was performed for 220 Asian breast cancer patients or their family members referred for genetics risk assessment. All 220 participants had at least one high-risk feature: having a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer in first- and/or second-degree relatives; having breast and ovarian cancer in the same individual or bilateral breast cancer; having early-onset breast cancer or ovarian cancer (â©½40 years of age). We identified 67 pathogenic variants in 66 (30.0%) patients. Of these, 19 (28.3%) occurred in BRCA1, 16 (23.9%) in BRCA2, 7 (10.4%) in PALB2, 6 (9.0%) in TP53, 2 (3.0%) in PTEN, 2 (3.0%) in CDH1 and 15 (22.4%) in other predisposition genes. Notably, 47.8% of pathogenic variants were in non-BRCA1/2 genes. Of the 66 patients with pathogenic mutations, 63.6% (42/66) were under the age of 40 years. Family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer is enriched in patients with BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants but less predictive for non-BRCA1/2 related pathogenic variations. We detected a median of three variants of unknown significance (VUS) per gene (range 0-21). Custom gene panel testing is feasible and useful for the detection of pathogenic mutations and should be done in the setting of a formal clinical cancer genetics service given the rate of VUS.

Germline p53 mutation in a Micronesian child with adrenocortical carcinoma and subsequent osteosarcoma
In 1990, an 18-month-old Micronesian girl was initially diagnosed with a right adrenocortical carcinoma. More than a decade later (2003), she was diagnosed with metastatic osteosarcoma with the primary in her right proximal fibula. Given this child's remarkable history of malignancy, she underwent testing for a genetic mutation that is associated with increased cancer formation. One such cancer syndrome is called Li-Fraumeni syndrome where approximately 70% of patients carry a genetic mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Patients with LFS are at risk for developing cancers of the breast, soft tissues, brain, bone, adrenal gland, and blood cells. Mutational analysis of our patient did reveal the presence of a germline mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. She was found to have a base pair change (A-->C) at nucleotide 394 resulting in a lysine to glutamine amino acid change at codon 132 (K132Q), which remarkably has never been described in association with either adrenocortical carcinoma or osteosarcoma.

DNA damage-associated dysregulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis control in cells with germ-line p53 mutation
Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) with heterozygous p53 mutations at residues 286A, 133R, 282W, 132E, and 213ter were established from five independent Li-Fraumeni syndrome families. When cell cycle regulation in response to gamma-irradiation was studied, these LCLs showed an abnormal G1 checkpoint associated with defective inhibition of cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity in all cases except for 282W LCL, which showed a normal G1 checkpoint. On the other hand, the control of S-phase-G2 as determined by cyclin A/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity was defective in all these LCLs. The mitotic checkpoint was also defective in the two LCLs analyzed as either competent or incompetent for G1 arrest. When radiation-induced apoptosis, which requires wild-type p53 function under optimal conditions, was studied, all of these LCLs showed significant failure compared to normal LCLs. These findings indicate that although p53-dependent transactivation and G1-S-phase cell cycle control are variably dysregulated, the induction of apoptosis and control of the cell cycle at S-phase-G2 and the mitotic checkpoint in response to DNA-damaging agents are consistently dysregulated in heterozygous mutant LCLs. This suggests that these dysfunctions underlie, at least in part, the susceptibility of Li-Fraumeni syndrome families to cancer. Furthermore, the approach presented is a potentially useful method for studying individual carriers of different germ-line p53 mutations and different biological features.

Germline p53 mutation at codon 133 in a cancer-prone family
We identified four families in which we suspected the presence of genetic factors predisposing them to cancer. We examined one family with features suggesting Li-Fraumeni syndrome for the presence of a germline p53 mutation in 13 of its members. To detect germline p53 mutations we performed polymerase chain reaction/nonradioisotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis on exons 4-9 of the p53 gene. Mutated polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was also performed on exon 5 to confirm the mutation identified by the sequencing analysis. A novel germline p53 mutation was identified at codon 133 (ATG-->AGG) in exon 5, resulting in the substitution of arginine for methionine, in all four cancer-affected individuals and in three apparently healthy individuals. We also analyzed tumor specimens for additional p53 mutations in the wild-type alleles using the same methods. However, heterozygosity was retained, and no other additional mutations in the wild-type allele were identified in any of the tumor tissues. It is possible that additional mutations in the wild-type allele are not always necessary for the loss of tumor suppressor functions. This study presents serious clinical and ethical problems about the predictive value of identifying germline p53 mutations in presymptomatic carriers. However, accurate predictive testing will be very useful in identifying unaffected individuals who are at increased risk of developing cancer and in detecting cancer at an early stage.

Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome mutations in p53 are associated with exonic methylation and splicing regulatory elements
Mutations in codon 133 of p53, which cause the loss of the Delta 133 isoform(s) expression, are very frequent in the Li-Fraumeni (LF) and Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndromes. In sporadic cancers, silent p53 mutations are correlated with exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and exonic methylated sites. The present study shows that mutations in splice sites are also very frequent in LF/LFL syndromes, while missense mutations are less common compared to other familial or sporadic cancers (P = 0 in both cases). Furthermore, it is shown that the codons at which LF/LFL germline missense mutations occur, correlate with CpG-containing ESEs (r = 0.181, P = 0.014) which are all methylated in p53. While both silent and LF/LFL missense mutations correlate with SC35 motifs, only the latter are associated with SRp55. On the contrary, only silent mutations in sporadic cancers correlate with SF2/ASF motifs in p53. Moreover, 12.1% of LF/LFL missense mutations involve the formation of potential splice sites of considerable splicing scores. Finally, mutations that are not at, or adjacent to CpGs (+/-1 codon, 34% of all LF/LFL mutated sites), introduce considerable changes of the ESE scores (>1.3 score change). The above data verify that LF/LFL missense mutations probably result also in splicing deregulation, in addition to any changes of the protein function and are mostly associated with alterations of the exonic methylation landscape. Some of the ESEs affected in LF/LFL syndromes are also genetically unstable in sporadic cancers but non-CpG cytosine instability, which is predominantly associated with specific ESEs, is only common in sporadic cancers.

A germ line mutation in exon 5 of the p53 gene in an extended cancer family
Germ line p53 point mutations have been reported for some families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a syndrome characterized by a dominantly inherited increased susceptibility for the development of early age of onset neoplasms of diverse origin in multiple family members. All of the initially reported p53 germ line mutations have been found exclusively within a single conserved, nonpolymorphic region of the gene between condons 245 and 258. The restricted distribution of these inherited mutations has led to speculation that germ line p53 mutations have unique properties [B. Vogelstein, Nature (Lond.), 348: 681-682, 1990]. We report here on the identification of a p53 germ line mutation at codon 133 (ATG----ACG) in nine members of an extended Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. This mutation leads to an amino acid substitution in the protein and is shown to completely cosegregate with Li-Fraumeni syndrome associated cancer in this family. Its location extends the region of the p53 gene where inherited mutations predisposing to cancer are observed and suggests that their distribution may be diverse.

TP53 mutation and haplotype analysis of two large African American families
Two large apparently unrelated African American families with a high incidence of breast cancer and other tumors characteristic of Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome were studied. Mutation screening revealed that in both families the affected members carried a germline mutation of the TP53 gene at codon 133 (ATG--> ACG, M133T). In order to determine whether an ancestral haplotype was shared by these two families, polymorphic markers within and flanking the TP53 gene were studied. Haplotype analysis using five markers revealed an identical haplotype shared by the two families. Loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus in the probands' tumor tissues from each family was observed; in each case, the retained allele carried the common haplotype. The frequency of this haplotype in the general African American population is <0.003. This unique haplotype, combined with the rare TP53 mutation, suggests that these African American families share a common ancestry. This finding suggests that other African Americans may be carriers of this mutation and thus may be at risk of early-onset breast cancer or other cancers characteristic of the Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome. The finding of recurring mutations in African Americans may facilitate carrier screening and identification in this population.

Excessive genomic DNA copy number variation in the Li-Fraumeni cancer predisposition syndrome
DNA copy number variations (CNVs) are a significant and ubiquitous source of inherited human genetic variation. However, the importance of CNVs to cancer susceptibility and tumor progression has not yet been explored. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by a strikingly increased risk of early-onset breast cancer, sarcomas, brain tumors and other neoplasms in individuals harboring germline TP53 mutations. Known genetic determinants of LFS do not fully explain the variable clinical phenotype in affected family members. As part of a wider study of CNVs and cancer, we conducted a genome-wide profile of germline CNVs in LFS families. Here, by examining DNA from a large healthy population and an LFS cohort using high-density oligonucleotide arrays, we show that the number of CNVs per genome is well conserved in the healthy population, but strikingly enriched in these cancer-prone individuals. We found a highly significant increase in CNVs among carriers of germline TP53 mutations with a familial cancer history. Furthermore, we identified a remarkable number of genomic regions in which known cancer-related genes coincide with CNVs, in both LFS families and healthy individuals. Germline CNVs may provide a foundation that enables the more dramatic chromosomal changes characteristic of TP53-related tumors to be established. Our results suggest that screening families predisposed to cancer for CNVs may identify individuals with an abnormally high number of these events.

Germline-focussed analysis of tumour-only sequencing: recommendations from the ESMO Precision Medicine Working Group
It is increasingly common in oncology practice to perform tumour sequencing using large cancer panels. For pathogenic sequence variants in cancer susceptibility genes identified on tumour-only sequencing, it is often unclear whether they are of somatic or constitutional (germline) origin. There is wide-spread disparity regarding both the extent to which systematic 'germline-focussed analysis' is carried out upon tumour sequencing data and for which variants follow-up analysis of a germline sample is carried out. Here we present analyses of paired sequencing data from 17 152 cancer samples, in which 1494 pathogenic sequence variants were identified across 65 cancer susceptibility genes. From these analyses, the European Society of Medical Oncology Precision Medicine Working Group Germline Subgroup has generated (i) recommendations regarding germline-focussed analyses of tumour-only sequencing data, (ii) indications for germline follow-up testing and (iii) guidance on patient information-giving and consent.

Unique substitution of CHEK2 and TP53 mutations implicated in primary prostate tumors and cancer cell lines
Genetic defects in CHEK2 and TP53 have been implicated in prostate cancer development. However, the interaction of these two genes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis has not been investigated. We previously described 11 CHEK2 mutations in a group of 84 primary prostate tumors. In this report, we screened the same group of tumors for TP53 mutations and revealed nine somatic and two germline mutations. One germline TP53 mutation (c.408A > T/p.Gln136His) and two somatic mutations (c.1022T > G/p.Phe341Cys and c.108-109ins22/p.His37fsX13) are novel to human cancer. More interestingly, CHEK2 and TP53 mutations were observed to be mutually substituted in these tumors. Analysis of five commonly used prostate cancer cell lines revealed that four cell lines harboring TP53 mutations carry no CHEK2 mutation while the only cell line (LNCaP) carrying wild-type TP53 harbors a CHEK2 mutation. The novel CHEK2 mutation (c.1160C>T/p.Thr387Asn) identified in LNCaP cells changes amino acid Thr387 to Asn which has been shown to impair CHEK2 autophosphorylation and activation. Our data suggest that the CHEK2 and TP53 mutations can substitute each other in at least 25% (21/84) of prostate cancers and that DNA damage-signaling pathway plays an important role in prostate cancer tumorigenesis.

Germ-line mutations of TP53 in Li-Fraumeni families: an extended study of 39 families
We have previously reported on the analysis of TP53 coding mutations in 12 classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) families plus 9 families that were Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) families (J. M. Birch et al., Cancer Res., 54: 1298-1304, 1994). Mutations were found in 6 of 12 LFS families and in 1 of 9 LFL families. We have now extended these studies to include an additional nine LFS and nine LFL families, and TP53 mutations have been detected in eight of nine LFS families and in three of nine LFL families. Six of the new mutations described here are the same as those previously identified in other Li-Fraumeni families and are missense mutations at codons 245, 248, and 273 (in two families); a nonsense mutation at codon 209; and a mutation at the splice donor site in exon 4. The other five mutations are novel germ-line mutations and include missense mutations at codons 136 and 344, a 2-bp deletion within codon 191, a splice acceptor mutation in intron 3, and a 167-bp deletion of part of exon 1 and intron 1. In addition, we have detected a codon 175 mutation in a family previously reported as TP53 negative. To summarize all of the data from the families we have studied in this and our previous report (J. M. Birch et al., Cancer Res., 54: 1298-1304, 1994), mutations have been detected in 15 of 21 LFS families (71%) and in 4 of 18 LFL families (22%). These figures are somewhat higher than those previously reported by us and others for the frequency of TP53 mutations in LFS and LFL families. This could reflect our analysis of all 11 exons of TP53, including noncoding regions, as well as the use of direct sequencing rather than other less-sensitive mutation detection methods.

Two Li-Fraumeni syndrome families with novel germline p53 mutations: loss of the wild-type p53 allele in only 50% of tumours
We describe two Li-Fraumeni syndrome families. Family A was remarkable for two early childhood cases of adrenocortical tumours, family B for a high incidence of many characteristic cancers, including a childhood case of choroid plexus tumour. Using direct sequencing, we analysed exons 5-9 of the p53 gene in constitutional DNA of individuals from both families and found two novel germline mutations in exon 5. In family A, we detected a point substitution in codon 138 (GCC to CCC), which resulted in the replacement of the alanine by a proline residue. Family B harboured a single-base pair deletion in codon 178 (CAC to -AC), resulting in a frameshift and premature chain termination. Three out of six tumours examined from both families, a renal cell carcinoma, a rhabdomyosarcoma and a breast cancer, showed loss of heterozygosity and contained only the mutant p53 allele. The remaining three neoplasms, both adrenocortical tumours and the choroid plexus tumour retained heterozygosity. Immunohistochemistry with anti-p53 antibody confirmed accumulation of p53 protein in tumours with loss of heterozygosity, while the remaining tumours were p53 negative. These results support the view that complete loss of activity of the wild-type p53 need not be the initial event in the formation of all tumours in Li-Fraumeni individuals.

Germline p53 gene mutations in subsets of glioma patients
Background:
        
      
      Heritable germline mutations of the p53 gene have been described in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, occasionally in nonfamilial malignancies such as multifocal osteosarcoma, in a small subgroup of young patients with two or more primary malignancies, and in patients with sporadic breast carcinoma. We recently reported that multifocal gliomas are frequently associated with other primary malignancies, and we hypothesized that genetic alterations may account for this phenomenon.

Comparable frequency of BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 germline mutations in a multi-ethnic Asian cohort suggests TP53 screening should be offered together with BRCA1/2 screening to early-onset breast cancer patients
Introduction:
        
      
      Germline TP53 mutations cause an increased risk to early-onset breast cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) families and the majority of carriers identified through breast cancer cohorts have LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) features. However, in Asia and in many low resource settings, it is challenging to obtain accurate family history and we, therefore, sought to determine whether the presence of early-onset breast cancer is an appropriate selection criteria for germline TP53 testing.

Rapid profiling of disease alleles using a tunable reporter of protein misfolding
Many human diseases are caused by genetic mutations that decrease protein stability. Such mutations may not specifically affect an active site, but can alter protein folding, abundance, or localization. Here we describe a high-throughput cell-based stability assay, IDESA (intra-DHFR enzyme stability assay), where stability is coupled to cell proliferation in the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The assay requires no prior knowledge of a protein's structure or activity, allowing the assessment of stability of proteins that have unknown or difficult to characterize activities, and we demonstrate use with a range of disease-relevant targets, including human alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), superoxide dismutase (SOD-1), DJ-1, p53, and SMN1. The assay can be carried out on hundreds of disease alleles in parallel or used to identify stabilizing small molecules (pharmacological chaperones) for unstable alleles. As demonstration of the general utility of this assay, we analyze stability of disease alleles of AGT, deficiency of which results in the kidney stone disease, primary hyperoxaluria type I, identifying mutations that specifically affect the protein-active site chemistry.

Germline mutations of p53 but not p16/CDKN2 or PTEN/MMAC1 tumor suppressor genes predispose to gliomas. The ANOCEF Group. Association des NeuroOncologues d'Expression FranÃ§aise
Constitutional DNA from 44 selected patients suspected of being genetically predisposed to develop astrocytic tumors was analyzed for germline mutations of the p53, p16, and PTEN genes. Six constitutional missense mutations of the p53 gene were identified (13.6%), but no mutations of the p16 and PTEN genes were found, suggesting that (1) germline p53 mutations contribute to a small portion of astrocytic tumors, (2) inherited mutations of the p16 and PTEN gene do not predispose to the development of gliomas, and (3) other genes are involved in glioma predisposition.

Comprehensive analysis of BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 germline mutation and tumor characterization: a portrait of early-onset breast cancer in Brazil
Germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 genes have been identified as one of the most important disease-causing issues in young breast cancer patients worldwide. The specific defective biological processes that trigger germline mutation-associated and -negative tumors remain unclear. To delineate an initial portrait of Brazilian early-onset breast cancer, we performed an investigation combining both germline and tumor analysis. Germline screening of the BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 (c.1100delC) and TP53 genes was performed in 54 unrelated patients <35 y; their tumors were investigated with respect to transcriptional and genomic profiles as well as hormonal receptors and HER2 expression/amplification. Germline mutations were detected in 12 out of 54 patients (22%) [7 in BRCA1 (13%), 4 in BRCA2 (7%) and one in TP53 (2%) gene]. A cancer familial history was present in 31.4% of the unrelated patients, from them 43.7% were carriers for germline mutation (37.5% in BRCA1 and in 6.2% in the BRCA2 genes). Fifty percent of the unrelated patients with hormone receptor-negative tumors carried BRCA1 mutations, percentage increasing to 83% in cases with familial history of cancer. Over-representation of DNA damage-, cellular and cell cycle-related processes was detected in the up-regulated genes of BRCA1/2-associated tumors, whereas cell and embryo development-related processes were over-represented in the up-regulated genes of BRCA1/2-negative tumors, suggesting distinct mechanisms driving the tumorigenesis. An initial portrait of the early-onset breast cancer patients in Brazil was generated pointing out that hormone receptor-negative tumors and positive familial history are two major risk factors for detection of a BRCA1 germline mutation. Additionally, the data revealed molecular factors that potentially trigger the tumor development in young patients.

Germline mutations and new copy number variants among 40 pediatric cancer patients suspected for genetic predisposition
Cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS) result from germline pathogenic variants, and they are increasingly recognized in the etiology of many pediatric cancers. Herein, we report the genetic/genomic analysis of 40 pediatric patients enrolled from 2016 to 2018. Our diagnostic workflow was successful in 50% of screened cases. Overall, the proportion of CPS in our case series is 10.9% (20/184) of enrolled patients. Interestingly, 12.5% of patients achieved a conclusive diagnosis through the analysis of chromosomal imbalance. Indeed, we observed germline microdeletions/duplications of regions encompassing cancer-related genes in 50% of patients undergoing array-CGH: EIF3H duplication in a patient with infantile desmoplastic astrocytoma and low-grade Glioma; SLFN11 deletion, SOX4 duplication, and PARK2 partial deletion in three neuroblastoma patients; a PTPRD partial deletion in a child diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme. Finally, we identified two cases due to DICER1 germline mutations.

A novel, de novo germline TP53 mutation in a rare presentation of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome in the maxilla
We undertook the genetic analysis of a classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) family with clustering of primary tumours including two maxillary sarcomas, a rare LFS site of tumour occurrence. Our aim was to investigate the presence of a specific type of TP53 mutation that could be associated with this unusual predilection of site for cancer occurrence. Mutational screening of the coding region of TP53 revealed an A>T transversion in codon 144 of exon 5 (CAG>CTG, Gln>Leu) in the germline of one of the three affected members, with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumour tissue. All other affected members were negative for germline or somatic TP53 mutations. TP53 immunohistochemistry was uninformative. The mutation we report is a de novo constitutional TP53 mutation that has not been previously described in the literature. It could explain the more burdened phenotype of the affected patient (died at 21 months). Alternative mechanisms to explain the overall family phenotype are discussed.

Multigene panel testing in unselected Israeli breast cancer cases: mutational spectrum and use of BRCA1/2 mutation prediction algorithms
Background:
        
      
      Studies assessing the contribution of non-BRCA1/2 gene mutations to inherited breast cancer (BC) predisposition consistently reported low (up to 4%) yield. The current study aimed at assessing the spectrum of non-BRCA mutations in unselected Israeli BC cases and the utility of BRCAPRO and Penn II models, as tools for prediction of detecting non-BRCA1/2 mutations in Israeli BC patients who tested negative for the predominant Jewish BRCA1/2 mutations.

Joint effects of germ-line TP53 mutation, MDM2 SNP309, and gender on cancer risk in family studies of Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare familial cancer syndrome characterized by early cancer onset, diverse tumor types, and multiple primary tumors. Germ-line TP53 mutations have been identified in most LFS families. A high-frequency single-nucleotide polymorphism, SNP309 (rs2279744), in MDM2 was recently confirmed to be a modifier of cancer risk in several case-series studies: substantially earlier cancer onset was observed in SNP309 G-allele carriers than in wild-type individuals by 7-16 years. However, cancer risk analyses that jointly account for measured hereditary TP53 mutations and MDM2 SNP309 have not been systematically investigated in familial cases. Here, we determined the combined effects of measured TP53 mutations, MDM2 SNP309, and gender and their interactions simultaneously in LFS families. We used the method that is designed for extended pedigrees and structured for age-specific risk models based on Cox proportional hazards regression. We analyzed the cancer incidence in 19 extended pedigrees with germ-line TP53 mutations ascertained through the clinical LFS phenotype. The dataset consisted of 463 individuals with 129 TP53 mutation carriers. Our analyses showed that the TP53 germ-line mutation and its interaction with gender were strongly associated with familial cancer incidence and that the association between MDM2 SNP309 and increased cancer risk was modest. In contrast with several case-series studies, the interaction between MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 mutation was not statistically significant in our LFS family cohort. Our results showed that SNP309 G-alleles were associated with accelerated tumor formation in both carriers and non-carriers of germ-line TP53 mutations.

Heterozygous TP53stop146/R72P fibroblasts from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome patient with impaired response to DNA damage
The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome, characterized by a wide spectrum of neoplasms, occurring in children and young adults. The identification of germline TP53 mutations in LFS has given rise to a number of in vitro studies using cultures of cancer cells and non-tumoral fibroblasts presenting germline TP53 mutations. In the present study, we performed a detailed documentation of the pedigree of an LFS family with a comprehensive analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations. We sequenced the TP53 gene and verified that the proband carries a germline nonsense mutation in codon 146 in one allele, the TP53Arg72Pro polymorphism in the second, and other intronic polymorphisms in the TP53 gene. In order to investigate the disruption of the p53 function in a patient presenting this mutation and the TP53Arg72Pro polymorphism who had so far suffered five malignant tumors and a benign meningioma, we tested her fibroblasts in response to DNA damage by evaluating the proliferation rate, apoptosis, and disruption of the TP53 pathway. The proband's heterozygous fibroblasts were not as efficient as control fibroblasts or those of her mother, who carried only the TP53Arg72Pro polymorphism, in causing cell arrest and cell death after DNA damage, which was correlated with diminished TP21 protein levels.

Anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma in TP53 germline mutation carriers
Background:
        
      
      Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) represents a diverse category of myogenic malignancies with marked differences in molecular alterations and histology. This study examines the question if RMS predisposition due to germline TP53 mutations correlates with certain RMS histologies.

Detection of Germline Mutations in a Cohort of 139 Patients with Bilateral Breast Cancer by Multi-Gene Panel Testing: Impact of Pathogenic Variants in Other Genes beyond BRCA1/2
Patients with unilateral breast cancer (UBC) have an increased risk of developing bilateral breast cancer (BBC). The annual risk of contralateral BC is about 0.5%, but increases by up to 3% in BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant (PV) carriers. Our study was aimed to evaluate whether all BBC patients should be offered multi-gene panel testing, regardless their cancer family history and age at diagnosis. We retrospectively collected all clinical information of 139 BBC patients genetically tested for germline PVs in different cancer susceptibility genes by NGS-based multi-gene panel testing. Our investigation revealed that 52 (37.4%) out of 139 BBC patients harbored germline PVs in high- and intermediate-penetrance breast cancer (BC) susceptibility genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, RAD51C. Nineteen out of 53 positively tested patients harbored a PV in a known BC susceptibility gene (no-BRCA). Interestingly, in the absence of an analysis performed via multi-gene panel, a significant proportion (14.4%) of PVs would have been lost. Therefore, offering a NGS-based multi-gene panel testing to all BBC patients may significantly increase the detection rates of germline PVs in other cancer susceptibility genes beyond BRCA1/2, avoiding underestimation of the number of individuals affected by a hereditary tumor syndrome.

TP53 gene mutations and 17p deletions in human astrocytomas
Astrocytomas, including the most malignant form, glioblastoma multiforme, are the most frequent and deadly primary tumors of the human nervous system. Recent molecular genetic analyses of astrocytomas have demonstrated frequent chromosome 17 deletions involving the telomeric region of the short arm (17p12-pter). This region contains a candidate tumor suppressor gene, TP53, which has recently been implicated in the etiology of a broad array of human cancers. To study the possible role of TP53 in astrocytoma development, 24 randomly chosen human astrocytic tumors were examined for genomic TP53 sequence aberrations using primer-directed DNA amplification in conjunction with direct sequencing. Five of the 11 grade III astrocytomas (glioblastoma multiforme), but only one of seven grade II astrocytomas (anaplastic astrocytoma) and none of either the grade I astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas demonstrated distinct point mutations involving the TP53 gene. These data suggest that TP53 mutations may play a role in astrocytoma development and are predominantly associated with higher grade tumors.

p53, CHK2, and CHK1 genes in Finnish families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome: further evidence of CHK2 in inherited cancer predisposition
Germ-line mutations in the p53 gene predispose individuals to Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). The cell cycle checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2 act upstream of p53 in DNA damage responses, and recently rare germ-line mutations in CHK2 were reported in LFS families. We have analyzed CHK1, CHK2, and p53 genes for mutations in 44 Finnish families with LFS, Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome, or families phenotypically suggestive of LFS with conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis. Five different disease-causing mutations were observed in 7 families (7 of 44 families; 15.9%): 4 in the p53 gene (5 of 44 families; 11.4%) and 1 in the CHK2 gene (2 of 44 families; 4.5%). Interestingly, the other CHK2-mutation carrier also has a mutation in the MSH6 gene. The cancer phenotype in the CHK2-families was not characteristic of LFS, and may indicate variable phenotypic expression in the rare families with CHK2 mutations. No mutations in the CHK1 gene were identified. Additional work is necessary to completely unravel the molecular background of LFS.

High frequency of germline p53 mutations in childhood adrenocortical cancer
Background:
        
      
      Adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC) is a rare childhood cancer, affecting three of 1 million children younger than 16 years old in the United States. ADCC may be found in association with the Li-Fraumeni and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes. Children with ADCC are also at substantially increased risk of second primary cancers. Because of these associations, it is believed that the genetic basis for ADCC is stronger than for most childhood malignancies. Germline mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene are associated with cancer predisposition in families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome as well as in individuals with sporadically occurring component tumors of the syndrome.

Constitutional p53 mutations associated with brain tumors in young adults
Identification of patients at risk for developing brain tumors is important for the development of preventative strategies. Because individuals with germline p53 mutations may be at increased risk, we examined DNA from brain tumor-derived cell lines and malignant and normal nervous system tissue for p53 gene mutations using the single strand conformation polymorphism assay and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA. We found mutations in the p53 gene in eight of 22 adult glioma tissue specimens and germline mutations in two of these eight patients. In contrast, mutation of the p53 gene was not detectable in either 16 glial tumors occurring in children, glial tumor tissue from three unrelated glioblastoma multiforme patients with a familial history of cancer, or in benign meningiomas. One constitutional p53 mutation was a G to T transversion at codon 154, and the second was a C to T transition at codon 256. Both patients with germline mutations developed glioblastoma multiforme before the age of 31, although the median age for glioma patients is above 50. These findings suggest that p53 germline mutations may identify a subset of young adults predisposed to the development of high-grade astrocytic tumors.

Two co-existing germline mutations P53 V157D and PMS2 R20Q promote tumorigenesis in a familial cancer syndrome
Germline mutations are responsible for familial cancer syndromes which account for approximately 5-10% of all types of cancers. These mutations mainly occur at tumor suppressor genes or genome stability genes, such as DNA repair genes. Here we have identified a cancer predisposition family, in which eight members were inflicted with a wide spectrum of cancer including one diagnosed with lung cancer at 22years old. Sequencing analysis of tumor samples as well as histologically normal specimens identified two germline mutations co-existing in the familial cancer syndrome, the mutation of tumor suppressor gene P53 V157D and mismatch repair gene PMS2 R20Q. We further demonstrate that P53 V157D and/or PMS2 R20Q mutant promotes lung cancer cell proliferation. These two mutants are capable of promoting colony formation in soft agar as well as tumor formation in transgenic drosophila system. Collectively, these data have uncovered the important role of co-existing germline P53 and PMS2 mutations in the familial cancer syndrome development.

Prevalence of deleterious mutations among patients with breast cancer referred for multigene panel testing in a Romanian population
Aim:
        
      
      Multigene panel testing for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) using next generation sequencing is becoming more common in medical care.We report our experience regarding deleterious mutations of high and moderate-risk breast cancer genes (BRCA1/2, TP53, STK11, CDH1, PTEN, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM), as well as more recently identified cancer genes, many of which have increased risk but less well-defined penetrance.

TP53 germline mutations in adult patients with adrenocortical carcinoma
Context:
        
      
      Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with germline mutations in TP53. According to the Chompret criteria for LFS, any patient with adrenocortical cancer (ACC), irrespective of age and family history, is at high risk for a TP53 germline mutation. However, whereas such mutations have been detected with high frequency in childhood ACC, a large cohort of adult patients with ACC has never been investigated for TP53 germline mutations.

P53 germline mutations in childhood cancers and cancer risk for carrier individuals
The family history of cancer in children treated for a solid malignant tumour in the Paediatric Oncology Department at Institute Gustave-Roussy, has been investigated. In order to determine the role of germline p53 mutations in genetic predisposition to childhood cancer, germline p53 mutations were sought in individuals with at least one relative (first- or second-degree relative or first cousin) affected by any cancer before 46 years of age, or affected by multiple cancers. Screening for germline p53 mutation was possible in 268 index cases among individuals fulfilling selection criteria. Seventeen (6.3%) mutations were identified, of which 13 were inherited and four were de novo. Using maximum likelihood methods that incorporate retrospective family data and correct for ascertainment bias, the lifetime risk of cancer for mutation carriers was estimated to be 73% for males and nearly 100% for females with a high risk of breast cancer accounting for the difference. The risk of cancer associated with such mutations is very high and no evidence of low penetrance mutation was found. These mutations are frequently inherited but de novo mutations are not rare.

Are there low-penetrance TP53 Alleles? evidence from childhood adrenocortical tumors
We have analyzed a panel of 14 cases of childhood adrenocortical tumors unselected for family history and have identified germline TP53 mutations in >80%, making this the highest known incidence of a germline mutation in a tumor-suppressor gene in any cancer. The spectrum of germline TP53 mutations detected is remarkably limited. Analysis of tumor tissue for loss of constitutional heterozygosity, with respect to the germline mutant allele and the occurrence of other somatic TP53 mutations, indicates complex sequences of genetic events in a number of tumors. None of the families had cancer histories that conformed to the criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, but, in some families, we were able to demonstrate that the mutation had been inherited. In these families there were gene carriers unaffected in their 40s and 50s, and there were others with relatively late-onset cancers. These data provide evidence that certain TP53 alleles confer relatively low penetrance for predisposition to the development of cancer, and they imply that deleterious TP53 mutations may be more frequent in the population than has been estimated previously. Our findings have considerable implications for the clinical management of children with andrenocortical tumors and their parents, in terms of both genetic testing and the early detection and treatment of tumors.

Germline Mutations in DNA Repair Genes in Lung Adenocarcinoma
Introduction:
        
      
      Although lung cancer is generally thought to be environmentally provoked, anecdotal familial clustering has been reported, suggesting that there may be genetic susceptibility factors. We systematically tested whether germline mutations in eight candidate genes may be risk factors for lung adenocarcinoma.

Analysis of hereditary cancer syndromes by using a panel of genes: novel and multiple pathogenic mutations
Background:
        
      
      Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes are responsible for approximately 5-10% of all diagnosed cancer cases. In the past, single-gene analysis of specific high risk genes was used for the determination of the genetic cause of cancer heritability in certain families. The application of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has facilitated multigene panel analysis and is widely used in clinical practice, for the identification of individuals with cancer predisposing gene variants. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent and nature of variants in genes implicated in hereditary cancer predisposition in individuals referred for testing in our laboratory.

Molecular assessment of clonality leads to the identification of a new germ line TP53 mutation associated with malignant cystosarcoma phyllodes and soft tissue sarcoma
Cystosarcoma phyllodes (CSP) is a rare breast neoplasm composed of stromal and epithelial elements. It usually runs a benign course but it may metastasize. In a 31-year-old patient with recurring CSP, a mesenchymal tumor in the leg developed. The question arose whether the latter tumor could be a metastasis from the CSP, which would have major treatment consequences. The problem was addressed using molecular methods, i.e., comparison of the pattern of polymorphic repeat markers on chromosome 17p as well as single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing of exons 5 to 8 of the TP53 gene in both tumor and normal tissue. An identical pattern of loss of heterozygosity in both breast tumors was demonstrated, but a different pattern was shown in the tumor in the leg. This led to the conclusion that the latter tumor had to be a new primary tumor. A mutation in codon 162 of the TP53 gene was found in the tumor tissue as well as in the normal tissue of this patient. This germ line mutation leads to the replacement of isoleucine by asparagine and most likely has functional consequences. In all four examined tumors of this patient, the normal TP53 allele was lost. This is strong evidence that this germ line TP53 mutation causes the genesis of these two rare primary mesenchymal tumors in this young patient. The current study exemplifies the power of molecular diagnostic methods in investigating the specific clinical problem of clonal relation between two separate tumors. The germ line mutation found in codon 162 of the TP53 gene and the association with cystosarcoma phyllodes have not been described previously.

Simultaneous Adrenocortical Carcinoma and Neuroblastoma in an Infant With a Novel Germline p53 Mutation
We present an infant with 2 simultaneous, but histologically distinct tumors with a novel germline p53 mutation. The child was found to have a paraspinal neuroblastoma, a concurrent adrenal cortical carcinoma, and an I162F p53 gene mutation. We review the associations of germline p53 mutations (or Li-Fraumeni syndrome) with both tumor types and the current research in similar germline p53 mutations. Finally, we discuss the multiple ways in which our patient is unique including the paucity of cases with simultaneous but histologically unrelated tumors and the fact that our patient is the first reported case of an I162F germline p53 mutation.

Germline mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in children with osteosarcoma
Purpose:
        
      
      We investigated the possibility that a significant proportion of children with osteosarcoma harbor germline mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and, therefore, this subgroup of pediatric cancer patients should be considered for large-scale predictive testing.

Detection of high frequency of mutations in a breast and/or ovarian cancer cohort: implications of embracing a multi-gene panel in molecular diagnosis in India
Breast and/or ovarian cancer (BOC) are among the most frequently diagnosed forms of hereditary cancers and leading cause of death in India. This emphasizes on the need for a cost-effective method for early detection of these cancers. We sequenced 141 unrelated patients and families with BOC using the TruSight Cancer panel, which includes 13 genes strongly associated with risk of inherited BOC. Multi-gene sequencing was done on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Genetic variations were identified using the Strand NGS software and interpreted using the StrandOmics platform. We were able to detect pathogenic mutations in 51 (36.2%) cases, out of which 19 were novel mutations. When we considered familial breast cancer cases only, the detection rate increased to 52%. When cases were stratified based on age of diagnosis into three categories, â©½40 years, 40-50 years and >50 years, the detection rates were higher in the first two categories (44.4% and 53.4%, respectively) as compared with the third category, in which it was 26.9%. Our study suggests that next-generation sequencing-based multi-gene panels increase the sensitivity of mutation detection and help in identifying patients with a high risk of developing cancer as compared with sequential tests of individual genes.

Identification and characterization of TP53 gene Allele Dropout in Li-Fraumeni syndrome and Oral cancer cohorts
Allele Drop out (ADO) arising from non-amplification of one allele may produce false negative result and impact clinical management. In cancer, germline and somatic genetic analysis is being increasingly used but the prevalence, nature and implications of ADO has not been studied in any cohort. In a cohort of 290 Li Fraumeni/Li Fraumeni Like Syndrome cases undergoing TP53 genetic testing, of the 69 pathogenic mutations identified so far, 5 were initially missed and 4 were misgenotyped as homozygous mutation due to germline ADO. Of the 9 germline ADOs, 8 were sequence dependent, arising from a polymorphism (rs12951053) in the primer annealing region of exon 7. Of 35 somatic TP53 variants identified by exome sequencing in 50 oral cancer tissues registered under International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), as a result of ADO, 4 were not detectable and 6 were not called as variant on Sanger Sequencing due to low peak height. High prevalence of germline and somatic ADO in the most frequently mutated cancer gene TP53, highlights the need for systematic evaluation of ADO prevalence and causes in clinically important cancer genes. False negative result for high penetrance germline mutations or actionable somatic mutations in oncogenes could have major clinical implications.

Mutation screening of germline TP53 mutations in high-risk Chinese breast cancer patients
Background:
        
      
      Germline TP53 mutations are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a severe and rare hereditary cancer syndrome. Despite the rarity of germline TP53 mutations, the clinical implication for mutation carriers and their families is significant. The risk management of TP53 germline mutation carriers is more stringent than BRCA carriers, and radiotherapy should be avoided when possible.

Cutaneous pleomorphic fibromas arising in patients with germline TP53 mutations
Pleomorphic fibromas are rare benign cutaneous neoplasms associated with deletion/loss of chromosomes 13q and 17p, where RB1 and TP53 are located, respectively. Herein, we report five cases of pleomorphic fibroma arising in patients with germline TP53 mutations, suggesting a potential link with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. All three patients were female and young (mean age 27) with a strong personal and/or family oncologic history and confirmed pathogenic germline TP53 mutations. In two patients, multiple pleomorphic fibromas were diagnosed. Clinically, the lesions arose at various cutaneous sites and were small (â¤2 cm) and raised (4/5). Histopathologically, the tumors were paucicellular, composed of atypical spindled to stellate cells with hyperchromatic and variably pleomorphic nuclei. Mitotic activity was exceedingly low, although rare atypical mitotic figures were seen in one case. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were diffusely positive for p16 (3/3) and showed loss of Rb expression (5/5). All cases showed aberrant p53 expression (overexpression in 4, complete loss in 1). The tumors have followed a benign clinical course with no evidence of progression or recurrence. In conclusion, the development of multiple pleomorphic fibromas in a young patient may be a clue to an underlying genetic cancer syndrome involving TP53.

TP53 germline mutation testing in early-onset breast cancer: findings from a nationwide cohort
Early-onset breast cancer may be due to Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS). Current national and international guidelines recommend that TP53 genetic testing should be considered for women with breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 31 years. However, large studies investigating TP53 mutation prevalence in this population are scarce. We collected nationwide laboratory records for all young breast cancer patients tested for TP53 mutations in the Netherlands. Between 2005 and 2016, 370 women diagnosed with breast cancer younger than 30 years of age were tested for TP53 germline mutations, and eight (2.2%) were found to carry a (likely) pathogenic TP53 sequence variant. Among BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation negative women without a family history suggestive of LFS or a personal history of multiple LFS-related tumours, the TP53 mutation frequency was < 1% (2/233). Taking into consideration that TP53 mutation prevalence was comparable or even higher in some studies selecting patients with breast cancer onset at older ages or HER2-positive breast cancers, raises the question of whether a very early age of onset is an appropriate single TP53 genetic testing criterion.

Prevalence of germline TP53 mutations and history of Li-Fraumeni syndrome in families with childhood adrenocortical tumors, choroid plexus tumors, and rhabdomyosarcoma: a population-based survey
Purpose:
        
      
      Whether childhood adrenocortical tumors (ACTs), choroid plexus tumors (CPTs), and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are early manifestation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of germline TP53 mutations and family history in a population-based series of patients.

The TP53 mutational spectrum and frequency of CHEK2*1100delC in Li-Fraumeni-like kindreds
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a dominantly inherited cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a wide spectrum of neoplasms occurring at young age. Germline mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene have been identified in approximately 71 of LFS patients and 22 of Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) patients. Mutations within the cell cycle checkpoint gene CHEK2 have also been reported in some patients with LFS, LFL, and phenotypically suggestive of LFS (PS-LFS) not carrying a TP53 mutation. In this study, we show that 7 of the 23 patients with LFS/LFL tested positive for deleterious mutations in p53. Fifteen of the remaining sixteen were not found to carry the CHEK2* 1100delCmutation. These results indicate that CHEK2*1100delC is not a common cause of LFS, LFL, or PS-LFS in North American kindreds not carrying a TP53 mutation. Of note, two patients were found to carry p53* R72P, which is of unknown clinical significance. Lack of segregation of this allele in one of these kindreds provides strong evidence that the R72P allele is not disease-causing. While mutations in p53 account for a proportion of patients with LFS/LFL, future studies are needed to determine if other genes are responsible for LFS/LFL families not carrying germline p53 mutations.

The TP53 mutation, R337H, is associated with Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like syndromes in Brazilian families
A TP53 germline mutation, R337H, has been previously described in children from southern Brazil with adrenocortical tumours but no documented familial history of other cancers. Here, we have screened for TP53 mutation 45 Brazilian unrelated individuals with family histories fulfilling the clinical definitions of Li-Fraumeni (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndromes. Mutations were found in 13 patients (28.9%), including six (46.1%) R337H mutations, and four novel germline mutations (V173M, V197M, G244D and IVS6+1G>T). Families with the R337H mutation presented a wide spectrum of tumours, including breast cancers (30.4%), brain cancers (10.7%), soft tissue sarcomas (10.7%) and adrenocortical carcinomas (8.9%). Testing of 53 Brazilian subjects with no cancer history showed that R337H was not a common polymorphism in that population. Moreover, loss of heterozygocity with retention of the R337H allele was observed in a breast adenocarcinoma, supporting a role for this mutation in breast tumorigenesis. These results show that the TP53 R337H germline mutation predisposes to a larger spectrum of tumours, similar to the one reported for other TP53 mutations.

Gain of function of a p53 hot spot mutation in a mouse model of Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome carry inherited mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene and are predisposed to tumor development. To examine the mechanistic nature of these p53 missense mutations, we generated mice harboring a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 515 of p53 (p53+/515A) corresponding to the p53R175H hot spot mutation in human cancers. Although p53+/515A mice display a similar tumor spectrum and survival curve as p53+/- mice, tumors from p53+/515A mice metastasized with high frequency. Correspondingly, the embryonic fibroblasts from the p53515A/515A mutant mice displayed enhanced cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and transformation potential. The disruption of p63 and p73 in p53-/- cells increased transformation capacity and reinitiated DNA synthesis to levels observed in p53515A/515A cells. Additionally, p63 and p73 were functionally inactivated in p53515A cells. These results provide in vivo validation for the gain-of-function properties of certain p53 missense mutations and suggest a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes.

Mutant p53 gain of function in two mouse models of Li-Fraumeni syndrome
The p53 tumor suppressor gene is commonly altered in human tumors, predominantly through missense mutations that result in accumulation of mutant p53 protein. These mutations may confer dominant-negative or gain-of-function properties to p53. To ascertain the physiological effects of p53 point mutation, the structural mutant p53R172H and the contact mutant p53R270H (codons 175 and 273 in humans) were engineered into the endogenous p53 locus in mice. p53R270H/+ and p53R172H/+ mice are models of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome; they developed allele-specific tumor spectra distinct from p53+/- mice. In addition, p53R270H/- and p53R172H/- mice developed novel tumors compared to p53-/- mice, including a variety of carcinomas and more frequent endothelial tumors. Dominant effects that varied by allele and function were observed in primary cells derived from p53R270H/+ and p53R172H/+ mice. These results demonstrate that point mutant p53 alleles expressed under physiological control have enhanced oncogenic potential beyond the simple loss of p53 function.

Identification of a novel germ line variant hotspot mutant p53-R175L in pediatric adrenal cortical carcinoma
Hotspot mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene result in the disruption of DNA contact points or alter the overall structure of the protein to prevent DNA binding. When inherited, hotspot mutants are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a familial cancer predisposition. One of the most common hotspot mutations occurs at codon 175, resulting in an arginine to histidine substitution. We have identified a novel germ line variant of the 175 mutant (Arg to Leu; R175L) in a pediatric patient who developed adrenal cortical carcinoma. Surprisingly, the family is not tumor prone or associated with LFS. In vitro, the R175L mutant displayed an attenuated tumor suppressor activity in the regulation of transcription, colony formation, and apoptosis when compared with wild-type p53 and the R175H mutant. These findings suggest that p53-R175L retains sufficient activity to suppress LFS, but not adrenal cortical carcinoma. Therefore, not all hotspot mutants are functionally equivalent and the biochemical nature of the mutant may significantly influence clinical outcome. The implications of these results for genetic counseling are discussed.

Multilocus Inherited Neoplasia Alleles Syndrome: A Case Series and Review
Mendelian causes of inherited cancer susceptibility are mostly rare and characterized by variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Phenotypic variability may result from a range of causes including locus heterogeneity, allelic heterogeneity, genetic and environmental modifier effects, or chance. Another potential cause is the presence of 2 or more inherited cancer predisposition alleles in the same individual. Although the frequency of such occurrences might be predicted to be low, such cases have probably been underascertained because standard clinical practice has been to test candidate inherited cancer genes sequentially until a pathogenic mutation is detected. However, recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies now provide the opportunity to perform simultaneous parallel testing of large numbers of inherited cancer genes. Herein we provide examples of patients who harbor pathogenic mutations in multiple inherited cancer genes and review previously published examples to illustrate the complex genotype-phenotype relationships in these cases. We suggest that clinicians should proactively consider the likelihood of this phenomenon (referred to herein as multilocus inherited neoplasia alleles syndrome [MINAS]) in patients with unusual inherited cancer syndrome phenotypes. To facilitate the clinical management of novel cases of MINAS, we have established a database to collect information on what is likely to be an increasingly recognized cohort of such individuals.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome
The Li-Fraumeni syndrome is characterized clinically by the appearance of tumors in multiple organs generally at an early age. This hereditary condition is caused by germinal mutations in the TP53 gene, which codifies for the tumoural suppressor gene p53. We present the case of a patient aged 31 with clinical and molecular diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome who presented two synchronous tumors: a leiomyosarcoma on the forearm and a phyllodes breast tumour. She had a family history of cancer, including a son diagnosed with a cortical adrenal carcinoma when he was three years old, who died at five from the disease. Furthermore, her maternal grandmother and great-grandmother died of stomach cancer at 56 and 60 years old, respectively, while her other great-grandmother and a great aunt presented with breast cancer at the ages of 60 and 40, respectively. After genetic counseling, complete sequencing and analysis of duplications and deletions in the TP53 gene were ordered prior to diagnosis. The molecular analysis of a DNA sample taken from peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed the germinal mutation c.527G>T (p.Cys176Phe) on exon 5 of the TP53 gene, a deleterious mutation described previously in tumoural tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first published case in Colombia of Li-Fraumeni syndrome with confirmed molecular diagnosis. The diagnosis and management of Li-Fraumeni syndrome should be performed by a multidisciplinary team, and genetic counselling should be offered to patients and their relatives.

Evaluation of ACMG-Guideline-Based Variant Classification of Cancer Susceptibility and Non-Cancer-Associated Genes in Families Affected by Breast Cancer
Sequencing tests assaying panels of genes or whole exomes are widely available for cancer risk evaluation. However, methods for classification of variants resulting from this testing are not well studied. We evaluated the ability of a variant-classification methodology based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to define the rate of mutations and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in 180 medically relevant genes, including all ACMG-designated reportable cancer and non-cancer-associated genes, in individuals who met guidelines for hereditary cancer risk evaluation. We performed whole-exome sequencing in 404 individuals in 253 families and classified 1,640 variants. Potentially clinically actionable (likely pathogenic [LP] or pathogenic [P]) versus nonactionable (VUS, likely benign, or benign) calls were 95% concordant with locus-specific databases and Clinvar. LP or P mutations were identified in 12 of 25 breast cancer susceptibility genes in 26 families without identified BRCA1/2 mutations (11%). Evaluation of 84 additional genes associated with autosomal-dominant cancer susceptibility identified LP or P mutations in only two additional families (0.8%). However, individuals from 10 of 253 families (3.9%) had incidental LP or P mutations in 32 non-cancer-associated genes, and 9% of individuals were monoallelic carriers of a rare LP or P mutation in 39 genes associated with autosomal-recessive cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, 95% of individuals had at least one VUS. In summary, these data support the clinical utility of ACMG variant-classification guidelines. Additionally, evaluation of extended panels of cancer-associated genes in breast/ovarian cancer families leads to only an incremental clinical benefit but substantially increases the complexity of the results.

Novel germ line mutation p53-P177R in adult adrenocortical carcinoma producing neuron-specific enolase as a possible marker
Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is a rare and aggressive endocrine tumor. The patient presented with a large retroperitoneum tumor and lung metastases. Removal of the adrenocortical tumor with part of the transverse colon and tail of the pancreas, spleen and kidney was successfully performed following chemotherapy. Levels of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were found to be markedly high before surgery and may be clinically useful markers for monitoring tumor status during management. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the cancer cells were positive for NSE and overexpression of p53. We identified a novel germ line variant of the 177 mutant (Pro to Arg; P177R) of p53 by genomic sequencing. The genetic and biochemical data presented in this case confirm the importance of screening for p53 status in ACC with inherited cancer syndrome.

Biochemical and imaging surveillance in germline TP53 mutation carriers with Li-Fraumeni syndrome: 11 year follow-up of a prospective observational study
Background:
        
      
      Carriers of a germline TP53 pathogenic variant have a substantial lifetime risk of developing cancer. In 2011, we did a prospective observational study of members of families who chose to either undergo a comprehensive surveillance protocol for individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or not. We sought to update our assessment of and modify the surveillance protocol, so in this study we report both longer follow-up of these patients and additional patients who underwent surveillance, as well as update the originally presented surveillance protocol.

Multiple malignancies in a child with de novo TP53 mutation
The authors present the case of an 8.5-year-old boy diagnosed with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the infratemporal fossa at 21 months old. Five years later he developed an osteosarcoma of the tibia, for which he was treated with standard chemotherapy and resection. Soon after completing this treatment, ptosis of the right eye developed. A mass in the cavernous sinus was found, interpreted as an osteogenic metastatsis, although a third primary tumor could not be ruled out. Molecular genetic investigation revealed a de novo germline TP53 mutation, and heralded an aggressive clinical progression of multiple malignancies in a child.

Detection of novel germline mutations for breast cancer in non-BRCA1/2 families
The identification of the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 enhanced clinicians' ability to select high-risk individuals for aggressive surveillance and prevention, and led to the development of targeted therapies. However, BRCA1/2 mutations account for only 25% of familial breast cancer cases. To systematically identify rare, probably pathogenic variants in familial cases of breast cancer without BRCA1/2 mutations, we developed a list of 312 genes, and performed targeted DNA enrichment coupled to multiplex next-generation sequencing on 104 'BRCAx' patients and 101 geographically matched controls in Ireland. As expected, this strategy allowed us to identify mutations in several well-known high-susceptibility and moderate-susceptibility genes, including ATM (~ 5%), RAD50 (~ 3%), CHEK2 (~ 2%), TP53 (~ 1%), PALB2 (~ 1%), and MRE11A (~ 1%). However, we also identified novel pathogenic variants in 30 other genes, which, when taken together, potentially explain the etiology of the missing heritability in up to 35% of BRCAx patients. These included novel potential pathogenic mutations in MAP3K1, CASP8, RAD51B, ZNF217, CDKN2B-AS1, and ERBB2, including a splice site mutation, which we predict would generate a constitutively active HER2 protein. Taken together, this work extends our understanding of the genetics of familial breast cancer, and supports the need to implement hereditary multigene panel testing to more appropriately orientate clinical management.

High frequency of de novo mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Background:
        
      
      Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline mutations in the TP53 gene. The frequency of germline de novo TP53 mutations is largely unknown; few unequivocal de novo mutations have been reported.

A novel p53 mutant retained functional activity in lung carcinomas
The gene p53 is a critical tumor suppressor that can respond to multiple signals of cellular gatekeepers for growth and division. The mdm2 gene is one of the downstream target genes for transcriptional activation by the product of p53 tumor suppressor gene. Transactivation of mdm2 gene is represented by the presence of a functional P53 protein. To understand the biological function of mutant p53 in tumorigenesis, we constructed a number of p53 mutants by site-directed mutagenesis (H179Y, L194R, S240R, R249S, A276D, E286Q), followed by characterization of each P53 mutant's ability to transactivate mdm2, bax and p21waf. The transactivation properties of p53 mutants were compared by co-transfection with pGL-3-mdm2, pGL-3-bax and pGL-3-p21waf into the P53 null cell line H1299 derived from a non-small cell lung carcinoma. Among them mt p53 S240R and E286Q were shown to have enhanced transactivating activity of pGL3-mdm2, at about 43.2 and 28.2% of the wt p53 vector, respectively, while the remaining four had nearly the same level of activity as the negative control did. Furthermore, data indicated that mt p53 S240R had as high an ability to suppress the growth of the p53 null cell line H1299 as wild type p53. Therefore, mutant p53 alone is an insufficient indicator of poor prognosis. Instead, functional p53 may affect lung cancer prognosis.

The over-expression of p53 H179Y residue mutation causes the increase of cyclin A1 and Cdk4 expression in HELF cells
Down-regulation of p53 expression has been found in a broad range of human cancers and cell proliferation disorders, indicating that p53 plays a key role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. In our current study, we transfected human embryonic lung fibroblast (HELF) cells with pcDNA3-wild-type p53 (pcDNA3-wtp53) plasmid, or pcDNA3-H179Y-mutated p53 (pcDNA3-mtp53) plasmid that mimics the mutation found in some human lung tumors, and further studied the role of p53 in the regulation of cell proliferation. Over expression of wild-type p53 caused cell cycle arrest at G1 phase with reduced cell size, decreased expression of cyclin D3, cyclin E, Cdk2 and Cdk4, and increased expression of p21. In contrast, over expression of H179Y-mutant p53 promoted G1 to S phase transition with enlarged cell size and increased cyclin A1 and Cdk4 expression in HELF cells. These results indicate that mutation at the p53 H179Y residue up-regulates cyclin A1 and Cdk4 expression, and promotes HELF cell proliferation.

Prevalence and diversity of constitutional mutations in the p53 gene among 21 Li-Fraumeni families
The entire coding sequence of the p53 gene was analysed for the presence of mutations in 12 families conforming to a restricted definition of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (classic LFS) and nine families with features of LFS conforming to a broader definition. Mutations were detected in seven families. Six were point mutations with one each affecting codons 175, 180, and 220 and three affecting codon 248. The seventh was a deletion/insertion mutation in exon 4. Germline mutations in p53 were a feature of families which included children with rhabdomyosarcoma and/or adrenal cortical carcinoma. Germline p53 mutations were detected in six of the nine families with such tumors. An analysis of these 7 mutations, together with 34 published examples, showed that more than one-half were transitions at CpG dinucleotides, suggesting that the majority of germline p53 mutations may arise as a result of spontaneous events. The most common cancers occurring in the 41 families with germline p53 mutations, in common with classic LFS, were bone and soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma, although less than one-half of the probands with germline p53 mutations came from classic LFS families. More than one-half of the cancers overall and nearly one-third of the breast cancers were diagnosed before 30 years of age. These observations have important implications for asymptomatic carriers of germline p53 mutations, and there is a need for international collaboration in the development of protocols for the management of such families.

Inherited p53 gene mutations in breast cancer
Recent evidence has implicated germ-line mutations of the p53 gene as the cause of cancer susceptibility in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, associated with the development of breast cancer and other neoplasms. Furthermore, somatic mutations of the p53 gene have been detected in a high percentage of non-familial breast cancers. We therefore sought to identify potential carriers of p53 gene mutations in a cohort of patients with early onset breast cancer. We examined 126 consecutive patients who developed breast cancer at or before the age of 40 for mutations of p53 within conserved regions of the gene. One patient with an inherited germ-line mutation of the p53 gene was identified but the functional significance of this mutation was not clear. It thus appears that only a small percentage of patients with breast cancer under the age of 40 carry germ-line mutations of the p53 gene, an observation which has implications for potential screening and risk assessment in such patients.

Screening for germ line TP53 mutations in breast cancer patients
The constant denaturant gel electrophoresis technique was used to screen for TP53 germ line mutations in 237 women with breast carcinoma (167 unselected patients, 30 patients with at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer, and 40 women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 35). A germ line mutation at codon 181 was noted in one of the unselected patients and a codon 245 mutation in one of the early-onset patients. Both had a family history of breast cancer and other malignancies suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The codon 245 mutation was also present in this patient's affected mother.

Radio-induced malignancies after breast cancer postoperative radiotherapy in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Background:
        
      
      There are no specific recommendations for the management of breast cancer patients with germ-line p53 mutations, an exceptional genetic condition, particularly regarding postoperative radiotherapy. Preclinical data suggested that p53 mutations conferred enhanced radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo and the few clinical observations showed that Li-Fraumeni families were at a higher risk of secondary radio-induced malignancies.

Identification of five new families strengthens the link between childhood choroid plexus carcinoma and germline TP53 mutations
We present five families of paediatric patients suffering from choroid plexus carcinoma in which we found germline TP53 mutations. Only one of the families conformed to the criteria of Li-Fraumeni syndrome and only three (including the Li-Fraumeni syndrome family) met the Chompret criteria for germline TP53 mutation testing. In the remaining two families no family history of cancer was identified and/or the parents of the patient were shown not to carry the mutation. Our results give further support to the notion that the occurrence of this rare paediatric tumour, especially in combination with a positive family history of cancer, but possibly also without any family history, may be an indicator of a germline TP53 mutation. The identification of this genetic defect has important consequences for cancer prevention and treatment in affected families.

Germline mutation prevalence in individuals with pancreatic cancer and a history of previous malignancy
Background:
        
      
      Approximately 10% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) cases are attributed to hereditary causes. Individuals with PC and a personal history of another cancer associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) or Lynch syndrome (LS) may be more likely to carry germline mutations.

Germline mutations of TP53 gene in breast cancer
Germline alterations of the TP53 gene encoding the p53 protein have been observed in the majority of families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare dominantly inherited disorder with breast cancer. Genomic DNA samples of 182 breast cancer cases and 186 controls were sequenced for TP53 mutations in the exon 5-9 and intervening introns 5, 7-9. Direct sequencing was done using Applied Biosystem 3730 DNA analyzer. In the present study, we observed nine mutations in the sequenced region, of which five were novel. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was done for all the mutations; C14181T, T14201G, and G13203A have shown deviation from HWE. High linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed between C14181T (rs129547788) and T14201G (rs12951053) (r (2) = 0.98.3; D' = 1.00), whereas other observed mutations do not show strong LD with any of the other mutations. None of the intronic mutations has shown significant association with the breast cancer, two exonic mutations G13203A (rs28934578) and A14572G are significantly (P = 0.04, P = 0.007) associated with breast cancer. Germline mutations observed in DNA-binding domain of the gene showed significant association with breast cancer. This study reports five novel germline mutations in the TP53 gene out of which one mutation may confer significant risk to the breast cancer. Mutations in DNA-binding domain of TP53 gene may play role in the early onset and prognosis of breast cancer. The population-based studies of germline mutations in DNA-binding domain of TP53 gene helps in identification of individuals and families who are at risk of developing cancers.

A novel p.Gly187Arg TP53 variant appears to result in Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome characterized by pathogenic variants in the TP53 gene on chromosome 17. The most common cancers in Li-Fraumeni kindreds include sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinoma. We report a 9-month-old male who was diagnosed with an adrenocortical tumor and later found to harbor a novel TP53 c.559 G > C germline variant, resulting in p.Gly187Arg. Family history included early-onset breast cancer in his paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandfather, as well as colon cancer at age 31 in a paternal cousin. The same TP53 variant was later confirmed in his paternal grandmother. Based on this information, his father (age 28, obligate carrier for the variant) was referred for colonoscopic screening and found to have multiple adenomatous polyps. This previously undescribed variant lies at an exon/intron boundary and is predicted to decrease splice site efficiency with resulting altered splicing or exon skipping. Our patient's family history provides limited evidence that this variant is a cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

Identification and characterization of two novel germ line p53 mutations in the non-LFS/non-LFL breast cancer families in Chinese population
Germ line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, p53, are known to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL). We sought to identify p53 germ line mutations in potential hereditary breast cancer patients without LFS/LFL phenotype, which will help us establish the genetic testing strategy for p53 in Chinese high-risk breast cancer families. We screened all coding exons and intron-exon boundaries of p53 in 240 women with early-onset breast cancer or affected relatives from four breast disease clinical centers in China by utilizing PCR-DHPLC and DNA sequencing analysis. Additionally, three cell lines (H1299, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231) were transfected with pEGFP-N1-only or pEGFP-N1 vectors expressing either wild-type or two novel identified mutant p53. And then we performed flow cytometry analysis in the transfected cells to determine the status of cell apoptosis, and real-time PCR as well as western blot analysis to ascertain the expression of p53, p21, and p27. Two novel germ line mutations (563T > C and 643_660del18) were detected in two independent families. Neither of them, however, was present in the 768 normal controls. Functional assays revealed that the ability to trigger cell apoptosis and transcriptional activation of target gene under similar expression of p53 were lower in two mutants versus wild-type p53. Deleterious mutations of p53 seemed to be responsible for approximately 1% of non-BRCA1/BRCA2 hereditary breast cancer in Chinese population, and our findings suggested that p53 should be included in genetic testing of Chinese non-LFS/non-LFL high-risk breast cancer families.

A novel case with germline p53 gene mutation having concurrent multiple primary colon tumours
During a search for causative genes in patients with concurrent multiple primary colon tumours, we found a novel case with a germline mutation of the p53 gene, from GCC (Ala) to GTC (Val) at codon 189. Of the six primary colon tumours that this patient had, one large advanced carcinoma exhibited a somatic p53 mutation and a somatic APC mutation, in addition to the germline p53 mutation. Two early carcinomas and three adenomas had somatic APC mutations but no somatic p53 mutation or loss of the p53 allele. K-ras-2 mutations were detected in an advanced carcinoma and an early carcinoma. The present results suggest that a patient with a certain type of germline p53 mutation is predisposed to concurrent multiple colon tumours. It is also suggested that in such a patient, a somatic APC mutation is involved in tumour formation and that an additional somatic p53 mutation contributes to tumour progression.

A novel germline TP53 mutation p.Pro190Arg detected in a patient with lung and bilateral breast cancers
Purpose:
        
      
      Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare genetic disease with strong predispositions to multiple early-onset neoplasms, mostly sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors and adrenocortical carcinomas (LFS core cancers). In most LFS families the germline mutations of TP53 tumor suppressor gene were found. Lung cancer does not belong to the core cancers of LFS, however its higher incidence is observed in families with TP53 mutations. Our aim was to search for TP53 mutations in female lung cancer patients whose clinico-demographic characteristics suggested a probable genetic predisposition to the disease.

Germ-line p53 mutations in 15 families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Germ-line mutations of the tumor-suppressor gene p53 have been observed in some families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a familial cancer syndrome in which affected relatives develop a diverse set of early-onset malignancies including breast carcinoma, sarcomas, and brain tumors. The analysis of the p53 gene in LFS families has been limited, in most studies to date, to the region between exon 5 and exon 9. In order to determine the frequency and distribution of germ-line p53 mutations in LFS, we sequenced the 10 coding exons of the p53 gene in lymphocytes and fibroblast cell lines derived from 15 families with the syndrome. Germ-line mutations were observed in eight families. Six mutations were missense mutations located between exons 5 and 8. One mutation was a nonsense mutation in exon 6, and one mutation was a splicing mutation in intron 4, generating aberrant shorter p53 RNA(s). In three families, a mutation of the p53 gene was observed in the fibroblast cell line derived from the proband. However, the mutation was not found in affected relatives in two families and in the blood from the one individual, indicating that the mutation probably occurred during cell culture in vitro. In four families, no mutation was observed. This study indicates that germ-line p53 mutations in LFS are mostly located between exons 5 and 8 and that approximately 50% of patients with LFS have no germ-line mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TP53 and CDKN1A mutation analysis in families with Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni like syndromes
Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni like syndromes (LFS/LFL) represent rare cancer-prone conditions associated mostly with sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinomas. TP53 germline mutations are present in up to 80 % of families with classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and in 20-60 % of families with Li-Fraumeni like phenotypes. The frequency of LFS/LFL families with no TP53 mutations detected suggests the involvement of other genes in the syndrome. In this study, we searched for mutations in TP53 in 39 probands from families with criteria for LFS/LFL. We also searched for mutations in the gene encoding the main mediator of p53 in cell cycle arrest, CDKN1A/p21, in all patients with no mutations in TP53. Eight probands carried germline disease-causing mutations in TP53: six missense mutations and two partial gene deletions. No mutations in CDKN1A coding region were detected. TP53 partial deletions in our cohort represented 25 % (2/8) of the mutations found, a much higher frequency than usually reported, emphasizing the need to search for TP53 rearrangements in patients with LFS/LFL phenotypes. Two benign tumors were detected in two TP53 mutation carriers: an adrenocortical adenoma and a neurofibroma, which raises a question about the possible implication of TP53 mutations on the development of such lesions.

Identification and characterization of a novel germline p53 mutation in a patient with glioblastoma and colon cancer
Germline mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been identified in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and patients with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL). However, to date, germline p53 mutations in patients not fulfilling the criteria of LFS or LFL have been reported only very rarely. In our study, a novel germline c.584T>C (p.Ile195Thr) mutation of the p53 gene was found in a 21-year-old male with a glioblastoma and colon cancer. He had no family history of cancer within second-degree relatives, and loss of the wild-type p53 allele and overexpression of p53 protein were observed in both tumors. Functional analyses revealed transactivation and growth suppressive function activities of the Thr195-type p53 to be impaired. These results suggest germline p53 mutations to possibly be responsible for a subset of young adult patient with multiple malignant tumors, even those not meeting the clinical criteria for LFS or LFL.

Genetic features of myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia in pediatric and young adult patients
The clinical and histopathological distinctions between inherited versus acquired bone marrow failure and myelodysplastic syndromes are challenging. The identification of inherited bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndromes is critical to inform appropriate clinical management. To investigate whether a subset of pediatric and young adults undergoing transplant for aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome have germline mutations in bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndrome genes, we performed a targeted genetic screen of samples obtained between 1990-2012 from children and young adults with aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome transplanted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Mutations in inherited bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndrome genes were found in 5.1% (5/98) of aplastic anemia patients and 13.6% (15/110) of myelodysplastic syndrome patients. While the majority of mutations were constitutional, a RUNX1 mutation present in the peripheral blood at a 51% variant allele fraction was confirmed to be somatically acquired in one myelodysplastic syndrome patient. This highlights the importance of distinguishing germline versus somatic mutations by sequencing DNA from a second tissue or from parents. Pathological mutations were present in DKC1, MPL, and TP53 among the aplastic anemia cohort, and in FANCA, GATA2, MPL, RTEL1, RUNX1, SBDS, TERT, TINF2, and TP53 among the myelodysplastic syndrome cohort. Family history or physical examination failed to reliably predict the presence of germline mutations. This study shows that while any single specific bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndrome genetic disorder is rare, screening for these disorders in aggregate identifies a significant subset of patients with inherited bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndrome.

HBOC multi-gene panel testing: comparison of two sequencing centers
Multi-gene panels are used to identify genetic causes of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) in large patient cohorts. This study compares the diagnostic workflow in two centers and gives valuable insights into different next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategies. Moreover, we present data from 620 patients sequenced at both centers. Both sequencing centers are part of the German consortium for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (GC-HBOC). All 620 patients included in this study were selected following standard BRCA1/2 testing guidelines. A set of 10 sequenced genes was analyzed per patient. Twelve samples were exchanged and sequenced at both centers. NGS results were highly concordant in 12 exchanged samples (205/206 variants = 99.51 %). One non-pathogenic variant was missed at center B due to a sequencing gap (no technical coverage). The custom enrichment at center B was optimized during this study; for example, the average number of missing bases was reduced by a factor of four (vers. 1: 1939.41, vers. 4: 506.01 bp). There were no sequencing gaps at center A, but four CCDS exons were not included in the enrichment. Pathogenic mutations were found in 12.10 % (75/620) of all patients: 4.84 % (30/620) in BRCA1, 4.35 % in BRCA2 (27/620), 0.97 % in CHEK2 (6/620), 0.65 % in ATM (4/620), 0.48 % in CDH1 (3/620), 0.32 % in PALB2 (2/620), 0.32 % in NBN (2/620), and 0.16 % in TP53 (1/620). NGS diagnostics for HBOC-related genes is robust, cost effective, and the method of choice for genetic testing in large cohorts. Adding 8 genes to standard BRCA1- and BRCA2-testing increased the mutation detection rate by one-third.

Novel germline mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in a child with incidentally discovered adrenal cortical carcinoma
Purpose:
        
      
      We report a case of adrenal cortical carcinoma in an infant, which was incidentally discovered by renal sonography after a urinary tract infection. The previous death of a sibling after rhabdomyosarcoma in infancy prompted a search for a heritable p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation in this family.

Multiple primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract: is there a role for constitutional mutations in the p53 gene?
Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) patients have a high risk of developing second primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract, the main cause of death. Although the roles of tobacco and diet in multiple head-and-neck carcinogenesis have been thoroughly investigated, little is known about individual genetic susceptibility factors involved in this process. Genomic instability, reflecting the propensity and the susceptibility of the genome to acquire multiple alterations, could be considered a driving force behind multiple carcinogenesis. Mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene has been proposed to play an important role in this process. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of inherited p53 germ-line alteration(s) in a population of 24 consecutive HNC patients and their first-degree relatives affected by multiple malignancies as well as the occurrence of p53 somatic acquired mutation(s) in 16 cancers, including first and second primaries from 5 HNCs of the same group. Mutations in exons 4-11 of the p53 gene were investigated using SSCP-PCR analysis and DNA sequencing. Analysis was extended to the peripheral blood and cancer biopsies available from first-degree relatives of cancer-prone families with p53 germ-line mutations. p53 germ-line mutations were identified in the peripheral blood and corresponding cancers of 3 HNC patients who had multiple malignancies. The only missense mutation detected was mapped in exon 6; it is a GTG to GAG substitution with an amino acid change from Val to Glu at codon 197. The remaining 2 p53 germ-line mutations were single-nucleotide substitutions without amino acid change in exon 6 (codon 213, CGA to CGG) and in exon 8 (codon 295, CCT to CCC), respectively. These mutations were found in HNC patients with a family history of cancer. Abnormal expression of wild-type p53 protein in normal and pathological tissues from patients with the same sense single-nucleotide substitutions was detected by immuno-histochemistry.

Clinical Features of Breast Cancer in South Korean Patients with Germline TP53 Gene Mutations
Purpose:
        
      
      Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal cancer syndrome caused by a germline mutation in the TP53 gene. Breast cancer in LFS patients is of various subtypes; however, limited data are available on the clinicopathological features of these subtypes and their appropriate treatments. This study aimed to review the clinical features and treatments for breast cancer in South Korean patients with germline TP53 mutations.

DNA methylation patterns of candidate genes regulated by thymine DNA glycosylase in patients with TP53 germline mutations
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare, autosomal dominant, hereditary cancer predisposition disorder. In Brazil, the p.R337H TP53 founder mutation causes the variant form of LFS, Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome. The occurrence of cancer and age of disease onset are known to vary, even in patients carrying the same mutation, and several mechanisms such as genetic and epigenetic alterations may be involved in this variability. However, the extent of involvement of such events has not been clarified. It is well established that p53 regulates several pathways, including the thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) pathway, which regulates the DNA methylation of several genes. This study aimed to identify the DNA methylation pattern of genes potentially related to the TDG pathway (CDKN2A, FOXA1, HOXD8, OCT4, SOX2, and SOX17) in 30 patients with germline TP53 mutations, 10 patients with wild-type TP53, and 10 healthy individuals. We also evaluated TDG expression in patients with adrenocortical tumors (ADR) with and without the p.R337H TP53 mutation. Gene methylation patterns of peripheral blood DNA samples assessed by pyrosequencing revealed no significant differences between the three groups. However, increased TDG expression was observed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in p.R337H carriers with ADR. Considering the rarity of this phenotype and the relevance of these findings, further studies using a larger sample set are necessary to confirm our results.

Germline mutations of multiple breast cancer-related genes are differentially associated with triple-negative breast cancers and prognostic factors
Genetic testing for BRCA1/2 mutations has become the standard clinical practice. Recent findings suggest the clinical significance of multigene panel testing of BRCA1/2 and other cancer-related genes. However, the clinical features of patients with breast cancer with germline mutations identified using multigene panels remain unclear. In this study, DNA samples from 583 Chinese women with breast cancer were subjected to target sequencing for 54 cancer-related genes using a pre-capture pooling method followed by next-generation sequencing. We identified 79 pathogenic germline mutations in 21 cancer-related genes. Forty-five patients (7.7%) harbored BRCA1/2 mutations, and 38 patients (6.5%) carried pathogenic mutations in the remaining 19 genes. PALB2 was the most commonly (1.2%) mutated gene other than BRCA1/2. Most of the identified pathogenic mutations were novel, suggesting mutation screening by using multigene panel testing is important particularly for non-European populations. Mutations in BRCA1/2 and the other cancer-related genes were differentially associated with clinical features. BRCA1 mutation carriers were strongly associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), whereas BRCA2 mutation carriers were not. Tumors in BRCA1-mutation carriers had a high histological grade. Patients with BRCA2-mutated breast cancers were likely to develop E-cadherin-negative tumors with bone metastases. Furthermore, mutations in PALB2 were strongly associated with TNBC. We demonstrated the usefulness of multigene panel testing and observed that a substantial proportion of patients with breast cancer had hereditary risk factors. Identifying differential associations between mutation status and clinical features will advance our understanding regarding the pathologies of this heterogeneous disease.

Identification of the Germline Mutation Profile in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Whole Exome Sequencing
Background: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is associated with poor prognosis and occurs with high frequency in China. The germline mutation profile in ESCC remains unclear, and therefore, the discovery of oncogenic alterations in ESCC is urgently needed. This study investigates the germline mutation profile and reveals associations among genotype-environment interactions in ESCC. Methods: Whole exome sequencing and follow-up analysis were performed in 77 matched tumor-normal ESCC specimens to examine the germline profiles. Additionally, associations among genotype-environment interactions were investigated. Results: We identified 84 pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations and 51 rare variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Twenty VUS with InterVar evidence of a score of moderate pathogenicity (PM) 2/PM2+ supporting pathogenicity (PP) 1 were found to have pathogenic significance. CYP21A2 was the most frequently mutated gene, and the p.Gln319* variant was identified in 6.5% (5/77) of patients. The TP53 p.V197E mutation, located within the DNA binding domain, was found in 1.3% (1/77) of patients. In total, the 11.7% (9/77) of individuals with homologous recombination (HR) VUS were more likely to have well-differentiated tumors than those without (P = 0.003). The degree of lymph node metastasis was correlated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and VUS group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the 10.4% (8/77) of individuals with mismatch repair (MMR) VUS had a higher tumor mutational burden (TMB), although the correlation was not significant. Conclusions: Our study identified the germline mutation profiles in ESCC, providing novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. Our results may also serve as a useful resource for the exploration of the underlying mechanism of ESCC and may provide information for the prevention, diagnosis and risk management of ESCC.

Blood RNA analysis can increase clinical diagnostic rate and resolve variants of uncertain significance
Purpose:
        
      
      Diagnosis of genetic disorders is hampered by large numbers of variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) identified through next-generation sequencing. Many such variants may disrupt normal RNA splicing. We examined effects on splicing of a large cohort of clinically identified variants and compared performance of bioinformatic splicing prediction tools commonly used in diagnostic laboratories.

A double germline mutations in the APC and p53 genes
Germline mutation in the APC gene is required for the initiation of the development of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). According to Fearon and Vogelstein model, further somatic mutations in the K-ras oncogene, DCC gene and p53 tumor suppressor gene are prerequisite for development of colon carcinoma. We have found that the germline mutations in the DNA isolated from lymphocytes of an 18 years old girl with extraordinary expressive phenotype in codons 1060-1061 of the APC gene result in truncation of the APC protein. The mutation in codons 12 and 13 of the K-ras oncogene was not detected, but another germline mutation was found in codon 210 of the p53 gene. Furthermore, no one of these germline mutations was detected in the DNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patient's 21 years old healthy sister. Until now, there has been no evidence about the expressive phenotype due to mutation in codons 1060-1061 of the APC gene; the role of germline missense mutation in codon 210 of the p53 gene in the FAP malignant process remains to be elucidated too. The effect of the combination of germline mutation in two different tumor suppressor genes in the progress of disease is discussed.

Assessment of TP53 Polymorphisms and MDM2 SNP309 in Premenopausal Breast Cancer Risk
Germline polymorphic variants in cancer predisposition genes such as TP53 have been shown to impact the risk of premenopausal cancer. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to assess the spectrum of polymorphisms in TP53 and its negative regulatory gene, MDM2 (SNP309:T>G) in patients with premenopausal breast cancer. Our findings in a cohort of 40 female patients demonstrate no significant correlation between the studied polymorphisms and risk of premenopausal breast cancer. Although one polymorphism is found in high frequency in this cohort (rs1800372:A>G, 9.0%), it was not associated with the risk of developing cancer before the age of 35 years in an extended cohort of 1,420 breast cancer cases. Functional studies of the rs1800372:A>G polymorphic allele reveal that it does not affect p53 transactivation function. Further study of variants or mutations in other cancer susceptibility genes is warranted to refine our understanding of the germline contribution to premenopausal breast cancer susceptibility.

Germline TP53 mutation spectrum in Sudanese premenopausal breast cancer patients: correlations with reproductive factors
Purpose:
        
      
      The role of non-genetic factors as modifiers of TP53-related hereditary breast cancer (BC) risk is debated. In this regard, little is known about the impact of germline TP53 mutations on BC in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease often presents in non-contraceptive multiparous premenopausal women with extended history of breastfeeding. Herein, we report the germline TP53 mutations found in a series of 92 Sudanese premenopausal BC patients characterized for reproductive history.

Nationwide germline whole genome sequencing of 198 consecutive pediatric cancer patients reveals a high incidence of cancer prone syndromes
Purpose:

A new germline TP53 gene mutation in a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
This report describes an unusual clinical presentation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Family history revealed a mild aggregation of adult cancers in one generation, and an unusual clustering of brain tumours of early childhood in the following generation. In order to evaluate the genetic basis for cancer predisposition in this family, molecular genetic analysis for the occurrence of germline TP53 tumour suppressor gene mutations was performed on 12 siblings of two generations. Indirect mutation analysis was performed by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique. Alterations were characterised by automated direct fluorescence sequencing analysis. Tumour material was also examined for p53 protein accumulation by immunohistochemistry. Initially, a TP53 gene germline missense mutation was detected in an 11-year-old kindred with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) following intensive treatment of a brain tumour. In peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of this proband, a reduction to hemizygosity occurred. During AML treatment, detection of LOH of 17p was used as a marker for clonality and treatment control. The mutation was found to be inherited from the proband's mother, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 48 years. Further, three siblings were carriers, and two are apparently healthy at the age of 21 and 23 years. Knowledge of germline mutations may allow accurate DNA-based carrier diagnosis which is of important clinical significance for treatment strategy and control. Furthermore, the occurrence of unaffected carriers in this family raises questions about appropriate methods of cancer surveillance and counselling for these people.

Analysis of TP53 germline mutations in pediatric tumor patients using DNA microarray-based sequencing technology
Background:
        
      
      Whereas in sporadic human malignancies mutations of the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene occur in cancers of almost every organ and histologic subtype, patients with an inborn TP53 defect are at high risk to develop, in particular, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors, leukaemias, adrenocortical tumors, and breast cancer. To demonstrate the usefulness of microarray technology applied to TP53 sequencing in pediatric tumors, we investigated young patients suffering from tumors typical of the Li-Fraumeni context who were, therefore, candidates for harboring inborn defects in tumor-suppressor genes.

Predominantly tumor-limited expression of a mutant allele in a Japanese family carrying a germline p53 mutation
Germline mutations of p53 have been implicated as a cause of cancer susceptibility in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Since inactivation of p53 has been suggested to play an important causative role in lung cancer, the present study of the prevalence of germline mutations in 148 patients with this neoplasm was performed. None of 138 randomly chosen patients were found to carry such mutations, while a single patient had a nonsense mutation at codon 213 among 10 patients selected for early onset and/or occurrence of multiple primary cancers. In contrast to the previous report of biallelic expression of p53 in a case with a germline missense mutation, preferential expression of the wild-type allele was observed in the heterozygous state in both normal lung and peripheral blood lymphocytes of our case, whereas expression of mutant mRNA was readily detectable in her lung cancer in the absence of the remaining wild-type allele. Interestingly, the family history of the proband showed a mild aggregation of adulthood cancers and a high prevalence of stomach cancer, a rare component in American families affected by the syndrome. These observations suggest the presence of heterogeneity with regard to molecular and clinical features of germline p53 mutations.

Prevalence of early onset colorectal cancer in 397 patients with classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Background & aims:
        
      
      Hereditary colorectal cancer is associated most commonly with the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. We investigated the prevalence of early onset colorectal cancer and the frequency of p53 germline mutations in 64 families from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) registry.

TP53 germline mutation testing in 180 families suspected of Li-Fraumeni syndrome: mutation detection rate and relative frequency of cancers in different familial phenotypes
BACKGROUND Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome. Most families fulfilling the classical diagnostic criteria harbour TP53 germline mutations. However, TP53 germline mutations may also occur in less obvious phenotypes. As a result, different criteria are in use to decide which patients qualify for TP53 mutation analysis, including the LFS, Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) and Chompret criteria. We investigated which criteria for TP53 mutation analysis resulted in the highest mutation detection rate and sensitivity in Dutch families. We describe the tumour spectrum in TP53-positive families and calculated tumour type specific relative risks. METHOD A total of 180 Dutch families referred for TP53 mutation analysis were evaluated. Tumour phenotypes were verified by pathology reports or clinical records. RESULTS A TP53 germline mutation was identified in 24 families. When the Chompret criteria were used 22/24 mutations were detected (sensitivity 92%, mutation detection rate 21%). In LFS and LFL families 18/24 mutations were found (sensitivity 75%). The two mutations detected outside the 'Chompret group' were found in a child with rhabdomyosarcoma and a young woman with breast cancer. In the mutation carriers, in addition to the classical LFS tumour types, colon and pancreatic cancer were also found significantly more often than in the general population. CONCLUSION We suggest TP53 mutation testing for all families fulfilling the Chompret criteria. In addition, TP53 mutation testing can be considered in the event of childhood sarcoma and breast cancer before 30 years. In addition to the risk for established LFS tumour types, TP53-positive individuals may also have an elevated risk for pancreatic and colon cancer.

Screening the p53 status of human cell lines using a yeast functional assay
We have screened the p53 status of 156 human cell lines, including 142 tumor cell lines from 27 different tumor types and 14 cell lines from normal tissues by using functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast. This assay enables us to score wild-type p53 expression on the basis of the ability of expressed p53 to transactivate the reporter gene HIS3 via the p53-responsive GAL1 promotor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Of 142 tumor cell lines, at least 104 lines (73.2%) were found to express the mutated p53 gene: 94 lines (66.2%) were mutated in both alleles, three lines (2.1%) were heterozygous, and no p53 cDNA was amplified from seven lines (4.9%). Of the 14 cell lines originating from normal tissues, all the transformed or immortalized cell lines expressed mutant p53 only. Yeast cells expressing mutant p53 derived from 94 cell lines were analyzed for temperature-sensitive growth. p53 cDNA from eight cell lines showed p53-dependent temperature-sensitive growth, growing at 30 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C. Four temperature-sensitive p53 mutations were isolated: CAT-->CGT at codon 214 (H214R), TAC-->TGC at codon 234 (Y234C), GTG-->ATG at codon 272 (V272M), and GAG-->AAG (E285K). Functionally wild-type p53 was detected in 38 tumor cell lines (26.8%) and all of the diploid fibroblasts at early and late population doubling levels. These results strongly support the previous findings that p53 inactivation is one of the most frequent genetic events that occurs during carcinogenesis and immortalization.

Cancer Susceptibility Gene Mutations in Individuals With Colorectal Cancer
Purpose Hereditary factors play an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, yet the prevalence of germline cancer susceptibility gene mutations in patients with CRC unselected for high-risk features (eg, early age at diagnosis, personal/family history of cancer or polyps, tumor microsatellite instability [MSI], mismatch repair [MMR] deficiency) is unknown. Patients and Methods We recruited 1,058 participants who received CRC care in a clinic-based setting without preselection for age at diagnosis, personal/family history, or MSI/MMR results. All participants underwent germline testing for mutations in 25 genes associated with inherited cancer risk. Each gene was categorized as high penetrance or moderate penetrance on the basis of published estimates of the lifetime cancer risks conferred by pathogenic germline mutations in that gene. Results One hundred five (9.9%; 95% CI, 8.2% to 11.9%) of 1,058 participants carried one or more pathogenic mutations, including 33 (3.1%) with Lynch syndrome (LS). Twenty-eight (96.6%) of 29 available LS CRCs demonstrated abnormal MSI/MMR results. Seventy-four (7.0%) of 1,058 participants carried non-LS gene mutations, including 23 (2.2%) with mutations in high-penetrance genes (five APC, three biallelic MUTYH, 11 BRCA1/2, two PALB2, one CDKN2A, and one TP53), 15 of whom lacked clinical histories suggestive of their underlying mutation. Thirty-eight (3.6%) participants had moderate-penetrance CRC risk gene mutations (19 monoallelic MUTYH, 17 APC*I1307K, two CHEK2). Neither proband age at CRC diagnosis, family history of CRC, nor personal history of other cancers significantly predicted the presence of pathogenic mutations in non-LS genes. Conclusion Germline cancer susceptibility gene mutations are carried by 9.9% of patients with CRC. MSI/MMR testing reliably identifies LS probands, although 7.0% of patients with CRC carry non-LS mutations, including 1.0% with BRCA1/2 mutations.

Diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome: Differentiating TP53 germline mutations from clonal hematopoiesis: Results of the observational AGO-TR1 trial
The Li-Fraumeni cancer predisposition syndrome (LFS1) presents with a variety of tumor types and the TP53 gene is covered by most diagnostic cancer gene panels. We demonstrate that deleterious TP53 variants identified in blood-derived DNA of 523 patients with ovarian cancer (AGO-TR1 trial) were not causal for the patients' ovarian cancer in three out of six TP53-positive cases. In three out of six patients, deleterious TP53 mutations were identified with low variant fractions in blood-derived DNA but not in the tumor of the patient seeking advice. The analysis of the TP53 and PPM1D genes, both intimately involved in chemotherapy-induced and/or age-related clonal hematopoiesis (CH), in 523 patients and 1,053 age-matched female control individuals revealed that CH represents a frequent event following chemotherapy, affecting 26 of the 523 patients enrolled (5.0%). Considering that TP53 mutations may arise from chemotherapy-induced CH, our findings help to avoid false-positive genetic diagnoses of LFS1.

A Japanese patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who had nine primary malignancies associated with a germline mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene
We describe a patient who had nine primary malignant tumors and a germline mutation in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, characteristically found in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). A 15-year-old girl with no family history of cancer was referred to our hospital because of pain and swelling of the right knee. Osteosarcoma was diagnosed. The patient received chemotherapy followed by surgery and had a remission. After the age of 28 years, nine primary malignant tumors developed successively, including right breast cancer, colon cancer, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the abdominal wall, right lung double cancers, bilateral breast cancers, and MFH of the left thigh. This is the second highest number of types of primary malignant tumors to be reported in LFS. All tumors were treated by a multidisciplinary approach, including surgery. Genetic analysis revealed a germline missense mutation in the p53 gene (c.659 A > G), resulting in Y220C, which has been reported in three families with LFS. The patient died of lung metastasis from MFH at the age of 37 years. Despite the multiple tumors, repeated induction of remissions resulted in long survival. Our findings suggest that a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, including surgery, is beneficial in patients with LFS.

Comparative analysis of the NF2, TP53, PTEN, KRAS, NRAS and HRAS genes in sporadic and radiation-induced human meningiomas
Irradiation to the head is associated with a significantly increased incidence of meningiomas. Radiation-induced meningiomas morphologically resemble their sporadically arising counterparts; however, they frequently exhibit a more malignant phenotype. Several genes have been shown to carry mutations in meningiomas, with the NF2 gene being most frequently affected. To examine whether the NF2 gene also plays a role in the development of radiation-induced meningiomas, we compiled a series of meningiomas from 25 patients with a history of previous cranial radiation. This series was compared with 21 atypical WHO grade II meningiomas and 15 anaplastic WHO grade III meningiomas, all from patients without a history of prior irradiation. NF2 mutations occurred significantly more often in sporadic atypical and anaplastic than in radiation-induced meningiomas (p < 0.02). In addition, all meningiomas were examined for mutations in the PTEN, TP53, HRAS, KRAS and NRAS genes. Two mutations in the TP53 gene in a sporadic and a radiation-induced tumor were detected. PTEN mutations were observed in 1 anaplastic and 1 radiation-induced meningioma. No structural alterations were seen in the RAS genes. Our data suggest that, while there is a certain overlap in the mutational spectrum, NF2 mutations may not play such a prominent role in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced compared to sporadic meningiomas.

Actionable exomic incidental findings in 6503 participants: challenges of variant classification
Recommendations for laboratories to report incidental findings from genomic tests have stimulated interest in such results. In order to investigate the criteria and processes for assigning the pathogenicity of specific variants and to estimate the frequency of such incidental findings in patients of European and African ancestry, we classified potentially actionable pathogenic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in all 4300 European- and 2203 African-ancestry participants sequenced by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). We considered 112 gene-disease pairs selected by an expert panel as associated with medically actionable genetic disorders that may be undiagnosed in adults. The resulting classifications were compared to classifications from other clinical and research genetic testing laboratories, as well as with in silico pathogenicity scores. Among European-ancestry participants, 30 of 4300 (0.7%) had a pathogenic SNV and six (0.1%) had a disruptive variant that was expected to be pathogenic, whereas 52 (1.2%) had likely pathogenic SNVs. For African-ancestry participants, six of 2203 (0.3%) had a pathogenic SNV and six (0.3%) had an expected pathogenic disruptive variant, whereas 13 (0.6%) had likely pathogenic SNVs. Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling mammalian conservation score and the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion summary score of conservation, substitution, regulation, and other evidence were compared across pathogenicity assignments and appear to have utility in variant classification. This work provides a refined estimate of the burden of adult onset, medically actionable incidental findings expected from exome sequencing, highlights challenges in variant classification, and demonstrates the need for a better curated variant interpretation knowledge base.

Germline p53 mutations are frequently detected in young children with rhabdomyosarcoma
We investigated the possibility that a proportion of children with sporadic rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) carry constitutional mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. 33 patients with sporadic RMS at two large outpatient pediatric oncology clinics submitted blood samples. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and PCR was used to amplify exons 2-11 of the p53 gene. Amplified genomic DNA was screened for the presence of germline p53 mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. The DNA sequence of those samples that showed aberrant migration of bands on SSCP analysis was determined to identify the precise nature of the gene mutations. Patient records were reviewed to assess clinical correlates of the mutant p53 carrier state. Heterozygous constitutional mutations were detected in 3/33 patient samples screened. Two of these missense mutations are located in exon 7 and one in exon 8 of the p53 gene. The presence of mutations was not correlated with tumor histology, stage, or site. However, an association between young age at diagnosis and presence of a constitutional p53 mutation was noted: 3/13 children under the age of 3 yr at diagnosis carried mutations, whereas none of 20 children over 3 yr of age at diagnosis harbored a detectable constitutional mutation. These results in children with RMS corroborates previous findings in other clinical settings suggesting that the mutant p53 carrier state may predispose individuals to malignancy at an early age. Although this study did not assess whether the mutations were preexisting or new germline alterations, assessment of close relatives of RMS patients for cancer risk and predictive genetic testing may be indicated.

Expanding the spectrum of germline variants in cancer
Our ability to identify germline variants in hereditary cancer cases remains challenged by the incomplete cataloging of relevant genes and lack of consensus on who should be tested. We designed a panel [hereditary oncogenesis predisposition evaluation (HOPE)] that encompasses most of the genes known to be associated with cancer development and tested its yield on more than 1300 samples of cancer patients. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in high and intermediate risk genes were identified in 16, 23.9, 9.7 and 2.7%, respectively, of peripheral blood or normal tissue samples taken from patients with breast, ovarian, colorectal and thyroid cancer. To confirm specificity of these findings, we tested an ethnically matched cohort of 816 individuals and only identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 1.59% (0.98% in high risk and 0.61% in intermediate risk). Remarkably, pathogenic or likely pathogenic alleles in DNA repair/genomic instability genes (other than BRCA2, ATM and PALB2) accounted for at least 16.8, 11.1, 50 and 45.5% of mutation-positive breast, ovarian, thyroid and colorectal cancer patients, respectively. Family history was noticeably lacking in a substantial fraction of mutation-positive cases (63.7, 81.5, 42.4 and 87.5% in breast, ovarian, colorectal and thyroid, respectively). Our results show high contribution of germline mutations to cancer predisposition that extends beyond "classical" hereditary cancer genes. Family history was lacking in 63.5% mutation-positive cases, shows that hereditary cancer need not appear familial and suggests that relaxed selection of cancer patients for hereditary cancer panels should be considered.

Germline TP53 mutational spectrum in French Canadians with breast cancer
Background:
        
      
      Specific germline mutations in the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility (HBC/HBOC) genes, BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, have been shown to recur in French Canadians of Quebec, Canada, and this has been attributed to common ancestors. Germline TP53 mutation carriers are known to segregate in Li-Fraumeni syndrome families, which feature young age of onset breast cancer. We have reported rare TP53 mutation carriers in French Canadian HBC families, though none recurred possibly due to the limited number of cancer families investigated. Here we describe TP53 germline mutations found in French Canadian cancer families provided from hereditary cancer clinics; investigate 37 new BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative HBC/HBOC families for the TP53 mutations; and assess the frequency of TP53 mutations in a 1235 French Canadian breast cancer cases not selected for family history of cancer.

Inherited mutations in cancer susceptibility genes are common among survivors of breast cancer who develop therapy-related leukemia
Background:
        
      
      Risk factors for the development of therapy-related leukemia (TRL), an often lethal late complication of cytotoxic therapy, remain poorly understood and may differ for survivors of different malignancies. Survivors of breast cancer (BC) now account for the majority of TRL cases, making the study of TRL risk factors in this population a priority.

Incidence of germ-line p53 mutations in patients with gliomas
Epidemiological studies on intracranial tumors have suggested that the observed familial aggregation of a proportion of gliomas may be due to inherited predisposition to their development. In the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) associated with germ-line mutations of the p53 gene, nervous-system tumors are observed with increased frequency. However, the contribution of germ-line p53 mutation to the incidence of brain tumors has not been investigated. In order to address this point, we have performed 2 independent investigations. First, we have examined an unselected series of brain tumors. Whenever the presence of a p53 mutation in the tumor was observed, the possible germ-line origin of the mutation was investigated. Germ-line p53 mutations were also analyzed in constitutional DNA of patients with gliomas that had been selected for an unusual personal or familial history of cancer. Germ-line p53 mutations were detected in 1 out of 80 unselected cases and in 3 out of 15 selected cases (20%). We conclude that germ-line p53 mutation may contribute to a small fraction of gliomas that develop in the general population. The presence of a personal or familial history of cancer in a patient with glioma should prompt the search for a germ-line p53 mutation. However, the low frequency of p53 germ-line mutation suggests that alterations of this gene may not account for most familial cases of gliomas.

Leukemic and non-leukemic lymphocytes from patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome demonstrate loss of p53 function, Bcl-2 family dysregulation and intrinsic resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs but not flavopiridol
Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is characterised by a predisposition to the early onset of certain tumors and is associated with germline mutation of the anti-oncogene p53. In this study we analysed the in vitro responses of lymphocytes from two LFS patients to chemotherapeutic drugs in terms of apoptosis induction and the expression of key intracellular proteins that regulate this process. One of the LFS patients also suffered from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and hence presented with a light-chain restricted B-cell lymphocytosis while the other patient had entirely normal blood counts. The B-lymphocytes from both LFS patients showed a marked degree of resistance to chlorambucil and fludarabine when compared to age-matched controls but were remarkably sensitive to the novel flavone, flavopiridol. Loss of function of p53 was demonstrated by a failure to induce Bax and p21 protein expression. In addition, altered basal expression patterns of Bcl-2 and Bax, two key regulators of apoptosis, were found in the LFS lymphocytes when compared with controls. These results suggest that LFS lymphocytes carrying a p53 mutation show intrinsic resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and this is associated with dysregulation of Bcl-2 family proteins. Furthermore, The innate resistance profile was similar in leukemic and non-leukemic lymphocytes and was therefore independent of genetic changes acquired during malignant transformation. Novel agents that induce p53-independent cell killing may be useful not only in the treatment of LFS-associated tumors but also drug resistant tumors in general where p53 and/or Bcl-2 family dysregulation is a feature.

Two TP53 germline mutations in a classical Li-Fraumeni syndrome family
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a combination of tumors including sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinoma and leukemia. Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are associated with LFS. We present a family with LFS in which initially a novel germline TP53 intron 5 splice site mutation was found. A second germline TP53 mutation, the exon 7 Asn235Ser (704A-->G) mutation, was detected in this family through pre-symptomatic DNA testing. This latter mutation has been reported repeatedly in the literature as a pathogenic mutation involved in LFS. We provide evidence for pathogenicity of the novel intron 5 splice site mutation, whereas this evidence is lacking for the exon 7 Asn235Ser (704A-->G) mutation. Our findings emphasize the importance of performing additional tests in case of germline sequence variants with uncertain functional effects.

Routine TP53 testing for breast cancer under age 30: ready for prime time?
It is well known that early-onset breast cancer may be due to an inherited predisposition. When evaluating women diagnosed with breast cancer under age 30, two important syndromes are typically considered: Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Many women are offered genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes; however, few are offered genetic testing for mutations in the TP53 gene. There is a concern that overly restrictive testing of TP53 may fail to recognize families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. We reviewed the genetic test results and family histories of all women with early-onset breast cancer who had genetic testing of the TP53 gene at the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children. Of the 28 women tested, six (33.3 %) had a mutation in the TP53 gene; a mutation was found in 7.7 % of women who did not meet current criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. By reviewing similar data published between 2000 and 2011, we estimate that 5-8 % of women diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer, and who have a negative family history, may have a mutation in the TP53 gene. Given the potential benefits versus harms of this testing, we discuss the option of simultaneous testing of all three genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53) for women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 30.

The impact of variant classification on the clinical management of hereditary cancer syndromes
Purpose:
        
      
      The reclassification of genetic variants poses a significant challenge for laboratories and clinicians. Variant review has resulted in the reclassification of variants of unknown significance as well as the reclassification of previously established pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants. These reclassifications have the potential to alter the clinical management of patients with hereditary cancer syndromes.

[Description of a new TP53 gene germline mutation in a family with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Genetic counselling to healthy mutation carriers]
Background:
        
      
      Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by early-onset breast cancer, soft-tissue sarcomas and osteosarcomas, acute leukemia, adrenocortical neoplasms and central nervous system tumors. Germline mutations in gene TP53 are identified in a percentage of affected families.

Contribution of Germline Predisposition Gene Mutations to Breast Cancer Risk in African American Women
Background:
        
      
      The risks of breast cancer in African American (AA) women associated with inherited mutations in breast cancer predisposition genes are not well defined. Thus, whether multigene germline hereditary cancer testing panels are applicable to this population is unknown. We assessed associations between mutations in panel-based genes and breast cancer risk in 5054 AA women with breast cancer and 4993 unaffected AA women drawn from 10 epidemiologic studies.

TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes are not commonly mutated in survivors of Hodgkin's disease with second primary neoplasms
Purpose:
        
      
      Despite recognition that second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) contribute significantly to mortality after the successful treatment of Hodgkin's disease (HD), little is known about the molecular events leading to secondary tumors. Factors contributing to second cancer risk include the carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, in combination with possible host susceptibility. To clarify whether host genetic factors contribute to secondary tumorigenesis, we performed mutational analyses of the TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes in a cohort of 44 HD patients developing one or more SMN.

Radiotherapy-induced malignancies in breast cancer patients with TP53 pathogenic germline variants (Li-Fraumeni syndrome)
The risk of radiotherapy-induced malignancies (RIMs) is a concern when treating Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni Like (LFL) patients. However, the type of TP53 pathogenic germline variant may possibly influence this risk. TP53 p.R337H mutation is particularly prevalent in Brazil. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of patients with pathogenic TP53 variants treated for localized breast cancer in a Brazilian cohort. We evaluated retrospectively a cohort of patients with germline TP53 pathogenic variants treated for localized breast cancer between December 1999 and October 2017. All patients were followed by the Hereditary Cancer Group of an academic cancer center. Our primary objective was to evaluate the occurrence of RIMs after adjuvant radiotherapy. Sixteen patients were evaluated; 10 (62.5%) had a germline TP53 p.R337H pathogenic variant. Median age was 39.8 years. Thirteen patients had invasive ductal carcinoma: 8 (61.5%) were hormone receptor-positive; 6 (46.1%), human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-amplified. Three patients had ductal carcinoma in situ. Most patients (N = 12/16, 75%) received adjuvant radiotherapy. After a median follow-up of 52.5 months, 2 patients (2/12, 16.6%) had RIMs. One had a fibrosarcoma and the other, a low-grade leiomyosarcoma. In the group treated with radiotherapy, one distant recurrence was diagnosed (1/12), and no loco-regional recurrence occurred. Among 4 patients who did not receive radiotherapy, 2 presented with loco-regional recurrence. In this cohort of patients with LFS enriched in TP53 p.R337H pathogenic variant, the incidence of RIMs after treatment of localized breast cancer was lower than previous literature. Nevertheless, rates of RIMs were still alarming. Early molecular diagnosis and careful evaluation of treatment risks and benefits are essential for these patients.

Number of rare germline CNVs and TP53 mutation types
Background:
        
      
      The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), an inherited rare cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a variety of early-onset tumors, is caused by different highly penetrant germline mutations in the TP53 gene; each separate mutation has dissimilar functional and phenotypic effects, which partially clarifies the reported heterogeneity between LFS families. Increases in copy number variation (CNV) have been reported in TP53 mutated individuals, and are also postulated to contribute to LFS phenotypic variability. The Brazilian p.R337H TP53 mutation has particular functional and regulatory properties that differ from most other common LFS TP53 mutations, by conferring a strikingly milder phenotype.

Allele-specific wild-type TP53 expression in the unaffected carrier parent of children with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder where an oncogenic TP53 germline mutation is passed from parent to child. Tumor protein p53 is a key tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Paradoxically, some mutant TP53 carriers remain unaffected, while their children develop cancer within the first few years of life. To address this paradox, response to UV stress was compared in dermal fibroblasts (dFb) from an affected LFS patient vs. their unaffected carrier parent. UV induction of CDKN1A/p21, a regulatory target of p53, in LFS patient dFb was significantly reduced compared to the unaffected parent. UV exposure also induced significantly greater p53[Ser15]-phosphorylation in LFS patient dFb, a reported property of some mutant p53 variants. Taken together, these results suggested that unaffected parental dFb may express an increased proportion of wild-type vs. mutant p53. Indeed, a significantly increased ratio of wild-type to mutant TP53 allele-specific expression in the unaffected parent dFb was confirmed by RT-PCR-RFLP and RNA-seq analysis. Hence, allele-specific expression of wild-type TP53 may allow an unaffected parent to mount a response to genotoxic stress more characteristic of homozygous wild-type TP53 individuals than their affected offspring, providing protection from the oncogenesis associated with LFS.

High-sensitivity microsatellite instability assessment for the detection of mismatch repair defects in normal tissue of biallelic germline mismatch repair mutation carriers
Introduction:
        
      
      Lynch syndrome (LS) and constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) are hereditary cancer syndromes associated with mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. Tumours show microsatellite instability (MSI), also reported at low levels in non-neoplastic tissues. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of high-sensitivity MSI (hs-MSI) assessment for the identification of LS and CMMRD in non-neoplastic tissues.

Screening of germline mutations in young Rwandan patients with breast cancers
Background:
        
      
      In Sub-Saharan Africa breast cancer is commonly detected at younger age and the profile is more aggressive with a high mortality rate compared to the European countries. It is suggested that African-specific genetic background plays a key role in this matter. The present study aimed at understanding the role of genetic factors in breast cancer development in young Rwandan.

Identification of a germ-line mutation in the p53 gene in a patient with an intracranial ependymoma
We detected a germ-line mutation of the p53 gene in a patient with a malignant ependymoma of the posterior fossa. This mutation, which was found at codon 242, resulted in an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved site of exon 7 of the p53 gene; the same mutation was found in both the germ-line and the tumor tissue. This is the most common region of previously described somatic p53 mutations in tumor specimens and of the germ-line p53 mutations in patients with the Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome. Evaluation of the patient's family revealed several direct maternal and paternal relatives who had died at a young age from different types of cancer. The association of a germ-line p53 mutation with an intracranial malignancy and a strong family history of cancer suggests that p53 gene mutations predispose a person to malignancy and, like retinoblastoma mutations, may be inherited.

Robust diagnostic genetic testing using solution capture enrichment and a novel variant-filtering interface
Targeted hybridization enrichment prior to next-generation sequencing is a widespread method for characterizing sequence variation in a research setting, and is being adopted by diagnostic laboratories. However, the number of variants identified can overwhelm clinical laboratories with strict time constraints, the final interpretation of likely pathogenicity being a particular bottleneck. To address this, we have developed an approach in which, after automatic variant calling on a standard unix pipeline, subsequent variant filtering is performed interactively, using AgileExomeFilter and AgilePindelFilter (http://dna.leeds.ac.uk/agile), tools designed for clinical scientists with standard desktop computers. To demonstrate the method's diagnostic efficacy, we tested 128 patients using (1) a targeted capture of 36 cancer-predisposing genes or (2) whole-exome capture for diagnosis of the genetically heterogeneous disorder primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). In the cancer cohort, complete concordance with previous diagnostic data was achieved across 793 variant genotypes. A high yield (42%) was also achieved for exome-based PCD diagnosis, underscoring the scalability of our method. Simple adjustments to the variant filtering parameters further allowed the identification of a homozygous truncating mutation in a presumptive new PCD gene, DNAH8. These tools should allow diagnostic laboratories to expand their testing portfolios flexibly, using a standard set of reagents and techniques.

Using a family history questionnaire to identify adult patients with increased genetic risk for sarcoma
Background:
        
      
      Sarcomas in adults can be associated with hereditary cancer syndromes characterized by early-onset predisposition to numerous types of cancer. Because of variability in familial presentation and the largely unexplained genetic basis of sarcomas, ascertainment of patients for whom a genetics evaluation is most indicated poses challenges. We assessed the utility of a Sarcoma Clinic Genetic Screening (scgs) questionnaire in facilitating that task.

Use of mutation spectra analysis software
The study and comparison of mutation(al) spectra is an important problem in molecular biology, because these spectra often reflect on important features of mutations and their fixation. Such features include the interaction of DNA with various mutagens, the function of repair/replication enzymes, and properties of target proteins. It is known that mutability varies significantly along nucleotide sequences, such that mutations often concentrate at certain positions, called "hotspots," in a sequence. In this paper, we discuss in detail two approaches for mutation spectra analysis: the comparison of mutation spectra with a HG-PUBL program, (FTP: sunsite.unc.edu/pub/academic/biology/dna-mutations/hyperg) and hotspot prediction with the CLUSTERM program (www.itba.mi.cnr.it/webmutation; ftp.bionet.nsc.ru/pub/biology/dbms/clusterm.zip). Several other approaches for mutational spectra analysis, such as the analysis of a target protein structure, hotspot context revealing, multiple spectra comparisons, as well as a number of mutation databases are briefly described. Mutation spectra in the lacI gene of E. coli and the human p53 gene are used for illustration of various difficulties of such analysis.

Germ-line transmission of a mutated p53 gene in a cancer-prone family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Tumour suppressor genes, whose usual function seems to be controlling normal cell proliferation, have been implicated in many inherited and sporadic forms of malignancies Much evidence supports the concept of tumour formation by loss-of-function mutations in suppressor genes, as predicted by the two-hit model of Knudson and DeMars. The suppressor gene, p53, is affected in such a manner by numerous mutations, which occur in a variety of human tumours. These mutations usually represent the loss of one allele and the substitution of a single base in the other. We have now analysed the p53 gene in a family affected by Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by the occurrence of diverse mesenchymal and epithelial neoplasms at multiple sites. In some instances the neoplasms seem to be related to exposure to carcinogens, including ionizing radiation. The Li-Fraumeni family that we studied had noncancerous skin fibroblasts (NSF) with an unusual radiation-resistant phenotype. DNA derived from the NSF cells of four family members, spanning two generations, had the same point mutation in codon 245 (GGC----GAC) of the p53 gene. This mutation leads to substitution of aspartic acid for glycine in one of the regions identified as a frequent target of point mutations in p53. The NSF cell lines with the mutation also retained the normal p53 allele. This inherited p53 mutation may predispose the members of this family to increased susceptibility to cancer.

Germ line p53 mutations in a familial syndrome of breast cancer, sarcomas, and other neoplasms
Familial cancer syndromes have helped to define the role of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer. The dominantly inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals. The rarity and high mortality of LFS precluded formal linkage analysis. The alternative approach was to select the most plausible candidate gene. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of most cancers that are associated with LFS. Germ line p53 mutations have been detected in all five LFS families analyzed. These mutations do not produce amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53 protein. The frequency of germ line p53 mutations can now be examined in additional families with LFS, and in other cancer patients and families with clinical features that might be attributed to the mutation.

Anaplastic Wilms' tumour, a subtype displaying poor prognosis, harbours p53 gene mutations
The genetics of Wilms' tumour (WT), a paediatric malignancy of the kidney, is complex. Inactivation of the tumour suppressor gene, WT1, is associated with tumour aetiology in approximately 10-15% of WTs. Chromosome 17p changes have been noted in cytogenetic studies of WTs, prompting us to screen 140 WTs for p53 mutations. When histopathology reports were available, p53 mutations were present in eight of eleven anaplastic WTs, a tumour subtype associated with poor prognosis. Amplification of MDM2, a gene whose product binds and sequesters p53, was excluded. Our results indicate that p53 alterations provide a molecular marker for anaplastic WTs.

Composite adrenal anaplastic neuroblastoma and virilizing adrenocortical tumor with germline TP53 R248W mutation
Composite tumors are extremely rare. Such tumors in adrenal glands are usually of neuroendocrine-neural type and occur mostly in adults. Their pathogenesis remains elusive. We report a patient with composite neuroblastoma (NB), adrenocortical tumor (ACT), and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) with germline TP53 R248W mutation. LFS predisposes to the development of leukemia, sarcomas, adrenocortical and breast carcinomas, brain tumors and, questionably, NB. A unique correlation between a single TP53 mutation (R337H) and ACT has been reported in southern Brazilian children. It remains unclear at this time whether a similar association of NB and R248W in patients with LFS exists.

Two germ-line mutations affecting the same nucleotide at codon 257 of p53 gene, a rare site for mutations
Codon 257 of the p53 gene is an extremely rare target for somatic mutations (accounting for only two of 1600 published mutations). We report here two constitutional mutations both affecting the second nucleotide of codon 257. A thymine to adenine transversion resulting in an amino acid change from leucine to glutamine was found in one proband who developed multiple independent malignant tumors (osteosarcoma, phyllodes tumor, soft-tissue sarcoma). Her mother died of early-onset breast cancer. In the other case, a deletion resulting in a frameshift in the C-terminal coding region of p53 was found in a woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 34. This woman belongs to a family with features of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In both cases, the p53 mutations identified in the proband was found in other members of the family. Codon 257, even if rarely mutated in somatic cells, may thus be an important target for germ-line mutations.

Three germline mutations in the TP53 gene
Three germline mutations in the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene are reported, two of which are not reported previously. A missense mutation at codon 265 of TP53 was found in three patients of a family that complied with the definition of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. A nonsense mutation in codon 306 was found in a woman who had had a rhabdomyosarcoma at age 4 and a subsequent breast cancer at age 22. She was part of a Li-Fraumeni-like family, but the parental origin of the mutation could not be traced. Finally, while screening for somatic alterations in TP53 in a series of 141 sporadic breast tumors, we detected a constitutional missense mutation in codon 235 in a woman diagnosed with breast cancer at age 26 and a recurrence 4 years later. The recurrence, but not the primary tumor, showed an additional missense mutation at codon 245 as well as loss of the wild-type allele. This suggests that the 245 mutation was particularly important for tumor progression and that there might exist heterogeneity in terms of cancer predisposition potential among the various germline TP53 mutations.

Rare TP53 variant associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome exhibits variable penetrance in a Saudi family
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant condition that predisposes individuals to a wide-spectrum of tumors at an early age. Approximately 70% of families with classic LFS have pathogenic variants in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 that disrupt protein function or stability. While more than 70% of pathogenic variants in TP53 are missense variants, the vast majority occur very infrequently, and thus their clinical significance is uncertain or conflicting. Here, we report an extremely rare TP53 missense variant, c.799C > T (p.Arg267Trp), identified in a 2-year-old Saudi proband diagnosed with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) and six of his first- and second-degree relatives. CPC is frequently found in families with LFS, and this is the first detailed report of a family with this variant. Intriguingly, the proband's father is homozygous for TP53 c.799C > T and phenotypically normal at 39 years of age. While loss of TP53 heterozygosity is often observed in tumors from individuals with LFS, homozygous germline TP53 pathogenic variants are rare. Based on our analysis of this single family, we hypothesize that TP53 c.799C > T has low or variable penetrance for LFS, with predisposition to the development of CPC. The observations from this family have furthered our understanding of the phenotypic variability that may be caused by one variant of TP53, even in the same family, and suggest that other factors (genetic and/or environmental) may play a role in mechanism of disease manifestation in LFS.

Hereditary and acquired p53 gene mutations in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia
The p53 gene was examined in primary lymphoblasts of 25 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia by the RNase protection assay and by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis in 23 of 25 cases. p53 mutations were found to occur, but at a low frequency (4 of 25). While all four mutations were identified by single strand conformation polymorphism, the comparative sensitivity of RNase protection was 50% (2 of 4). Heterozygosity was retained at mutated codons in 3 of 4 cases. One pedigree was consistent with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and bone marrow from both diagnosis and remission indicated a germline G to T transversion at codon 272 (valine to leucine). Although members of another family were affected with leukemia, a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 was nonhereditary. The other two nonhereditary p53 mutations included a T to G transversion at codon 270 (phenylalanine to cysteine) and a G to C transversion at codon 248 (arginine to proline). These data support the role of both hereditary and acquired p53 mutations in the pathogenesis and/or progression of some cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in a prospective series of unselected patients with adrenocortical carcinoma
Purpose:
        
      
      Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a hallmark cancer in families with Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) caused by mutations in the TP53 gene. The prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in children diagnosed with ACC ranges from 50-97%. Although existing criteria advocate for TP53 testing in all patients with ACC regardless of age at diagnosis, the overall prevalence of germline mutations in patients diagnosed with ACC has not been well studied.

Constitutional mutation in exon 8 of the p53 gene in a patient with multiple primary tumours: molecular and immunohistochemical findings
We report a constitutional mutation of codon 273 in exon 8 of the p53 gene. The affected individual has developed multiple independent benign and malignant tumours (tricholemmoma of the scalp, multiple trichoepitheliomata of the face, osteosarcoma of the ovary, bilateral breast cancer, malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the thigh and endometrial adenocarcinoma) and belongs to a family with some, but not all, features of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The mutation, found in both blood lymphocyte and tumour specimens, is a cytosine to thymine transition at codon 273, resulting in an amino acid change from arginine to cysteine. The mother and sister of the index case both died of tumours at an early age. We have demonstrated that formalin-preserved material from these tumours contains the same C-->T mutation at codon 273, indicating that this mutation has probably been transmitted through the germline. All tumours from the index case, both benign and malignant, showed immunohistochemical positivity with four antibodies to the p53 protein. Positive staining was also seen in scattered nuclei of morphologically normal epidermal keratinocytes and pilosebaceous cells, but not in lymphocytes or other morphologically normal cells from the index case. However, a similar staining pattern in apparently normal tissue was also observed in 13/48 sections from other individuals with various skin conditions (melanocytic naevi, psoriasis and normal skin adjacent to malignant melanoma and fibrous histiocytomas), suggesting that this pattern of p53 staining may not be unique to individuals with constitutional p53 mutations.

Screening for germ line p53 mutations in children with malignant tumors and a family history of cancer
We have undertaken a routine investigation of the p53 status for all the children treated at our institution either affected by multiple tumors or whose family displays at least one second degree relative or less, affected by cancer before the age of 45 years. We report here on the first set of ten such families, eight of which were identified through a proband with sarcoma. p53 exons 5 to 8 have been sequenced following polymerase chain reaction amplification performed on DNA isolated from total blood. A missense mutation affecting codons 248, 273, and 282 was identified in three families. The mutation was inherited in these three families and was detected in unaffected members. In seven families no mutation was detected in exons 5 to 8.

Germline mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in children and young adults with second malignant neoplasms
Background:
        
      
      Acquired mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene have been detected in several human cancers, including colon, breast, and lung cancer. Inherited mutations (transmitted through the germline) of this gene can underlie the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare familial association of breast cancer in young women, childhood sarcomas, and other malignant neoplasms. We investigated the possibility that p53 mutations in the germline are associated with second primary cancers that arise in children and young adults who would not be considered as belonging to Li-Fraumeni families.

Modulation of gene expression by tumor-derived p53 mutants
p53 mutants with a single amino acid substitution are overexpressed in a majority of human cancers containing a p53 mutation. Overexpression of the mutant protein suggests that there is a selection pressure on the cell indicative of an active functional role for mutant p53. Indeed, H1299 cells expressing mutant p53-R175H, p53-R273H or p53-D281G grow at a faster rate compared with a control cell line. Using p53-specific small interfering RNA, we show that the growth rate of mutant p53-expressing cells decreases as mutant p53 level decreases, demonstrating that the increased cellular growth is dependent on p53 expression. Increased growth rate is not observed for H1299 cell clones expressing mutant p53-D281G (L22Q/W23S), which has been shown to be defective in transactivation in transient transcriptional assays. This shows that the increased growth rate imparted by mutant p53 in H1299 cells requires the transactivation function of mutant p53. By performing microarray hybridization analyses, we show that constitutive expression of three common p53 mutants (p53-R175H, p53-R273H, and p53-D281G) in H1299 human lung carcinoma cells evokes regulation of a common set of genes, a significant number of which are involved in cell growth regulation. Predictably, H1299 cells expressing p53-D281G (L22Q/W23S) are defective in up-regulating a number of these genes. The differences in expression profiles induced by individual p53 mutants in the cells may be representative of the p53 mutants and how they can affect gene expression resulting in the observed "gain of function" phenotypes (i.e., increased growth rate, decreased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, and so forth).

Telomere length in peripheral blood cells of germline TP53 mutation carriers is shorter than that of normal individuals of corresponding age
Background:
        
      
      A decrease in the age at cancer onset and increase in cancer incidence in successive generations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) families with germline TP53 mutations have been previously described. In the current study a possible relation was analyzed between telomere length and cancer onset in TP53 mutation carriers.

Genetic evaluation based on family history and Her2 status correctly identifies TP53 mutations in very early onset breast cancer cases
Currently, hereditary breast cancer is being attributed to more than 20 genes of differing penetrance. Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 are still the genes of reference for breast cancer susceptibility, extreme breast cancer phenotypes may be the result of deleterious alleles of other genes. Here, we report three families with early-onset breast cancer that were initially referred for BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing. They were diagnosed with breast cancer at an extraordinarily early age. On the basis of their extensive family history, which included multiple cancer types, and their Her2 status, they were suspected for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Indeed, all three probands were found to harbor TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. These included p.C275X, described here for the first time, as well as p.R213X and p.Y220C, which have been described in the past. Our conclusion is that decisions on genetic analysis for inherited early onset breast cancer should always be based on detailed pedigree information, combined with Her2 status.

Clinical Actionability of Multigene Panel Testing for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Risk Assessment
Importance:
        
      
      The practice of genetic testing for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) is rapidly evolving owing to the recent introduction of multigene panels. While these tests may identify 40% to 50% more individuals with hereditary cancer gene mutations than does testing for BRCA1/2 alone, whether finding such mutations will alter clinical management is unknown.

Spectrum of mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, and TP53 in families at high risk of breast cancer
Context:
        
      
      Genetic testing for inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become integral to the care of women with a severe family history of breast or ovarian cancer, but an unknown number of patients receive negative (ie, wild-type) results when they actually carry a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Furthermore, other breast cancer genes generally are not evaluated.

Constitutive and DNA damage inducible activation of pig3 and MDM2 genes by tumor-derived p53 mutant C277Y
The p53 gene is compromised in most human cancers by point mutation. Evidence is accumulating that these alterations frequently do not result in a complete loss of the sequence-specific transcriptional regulatory function of p53. Here, we describe the transcriptional activity of the p53 mutant C277Y isolated from a Ewing's sarcoma with high constitutive pig3 expression. Transient transfection of this mutant into a p53 null cell line resulted in activation not only of the pig3 but also of the MDM2 gene compatible with the presence of constitutively expressed MDM2 transcripts initiated from the P2 promoter in the p53-C277Y hemizygous Ewing's sarcoma cell line. Expression of endogenous pig3 and MDM2 genes was further enhanced on irradiation of this cell line. Here, suppression of p53-C277Y by RNAi reduced pig3 promoter activity, RNA, and protein expression. Reporter gene assays revealed that the potential of p53-C277Y to up-regulate MDM2 expression was similar to wild-type p53, whereas activation of the pig3 promoter was at least 5-fold increased over wild-type p53. The pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence present in exon 1 of the pig3 gene was found to be responsible for p53-C277Y-mediated activation. In concordance with a role of PIG3 protein for cell death, we showed residual apoptotic activity of p53-C277Y to which the described Ewing's sarcoma cell line was found to be resistant. p53-C277Y has previously been reported to bind to DNA with altered sequence specificity and to be unable to activate generic p53 target genes in yeast-based functional assays. Our results, therefore, show that a p53 mutant may behave differently when tested in its authentic cellular context.

A constitutional de novo mutation in exon 8 of the p53 gene in a patient with multiple primary malignancies
We report a constitutional point mutation of codon 278 in exon 8 of the TP53 gene that has not yet been described as a germ-line mutation. A 52-year-old female developed multiple primary malignancies (liposarcoma, breast cancer, malignant histiocytoma, occult adenocarcinoma). The mutation found in her tumour and peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA is a cytosine to thymine transition at the second position of codon 278 resulting in an amino acid exchange from proline to leucine in the DNA-binding domain. Evaluation of the patient's family revealed that both of her sons were affected by the same mutation. Although the patient's mother had died already, we were able to demonstrate by polymorphic microsatellite analysis that the defective allele originated from the maternal side. As four brothers and one sister had inherited the same allele, which however was wild type, we were able to show that the mutation must have occurred in the germ cells of the patient's mother and that it may therefore be called de novo. This explains the lack of a high cancer incidence in the family history. All tumours tested showed positive immunohistochemical staining for p53. Loss of heterozygosity was found in five of seven tumours, one showing chromosome 17 monosomy.

Hereditary breast cancer syndromes in a Turkish population. Results of molecular germline analysis
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy which affects women. In 5-10% of all cases, breast cancer presents as a hereditary cancer syndrome. Since 1996, 68 families with suspicion of familial breast cancer have been referred to our department. In 5 of the 68 families (7.4%), the clinical diagnosis was hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome. In 17 families (25%), two or more breast cancer cases were present. Mutation screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in these families revealed a BRCA1 mutation (185delAG) in one family. Three families (4.4%) had a diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome and germline mutations in TP53 (Lys292Ile, Pro278Ser and Pro278Thr). Breast cancer occurred in a family with hereditary nonpolyposis colon carcinoma (HNPCC; Lynch syndrome) carrying an MLH1 mutation (IVS17-3G>C). Most of our families (41 families; 60.2%) had only one case with breast cancer or cystic adenoma (or both) and did not need counseling and DNA testing. In summary, in 10 of the 68 families in our series (14.7%), a germline mutation in a breast cancer predisposing gene was detected. Our data show the importance of detailed examination of clinical data, pedigree analyses, and molecular germline diagnostics for the counseling of breast cancer cases.

Whole-exome sequencing reveals germline-mutated small cell lung cancer subtype with favorable response to DNA repair-targeted therapies
Because tobacco is a potent carcinogen, secondary causes of lung cancer are often diminished in perceived importance. To assess the extent of inherited susceptibility to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most lethal type of lung cancer, we sequenced germline exomes of 87 patients (77 SCLC and 10 extrapulmonary small cell) and considered 607 genes, discovering 42 deleterious variants in 35 cancer-predisposition genes among 43.7% of patients. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 79 patients with SCLC. Loss of heterozygosity was observed in 3 of 14 (21.4%) tumors. Identification of variants influenced medical management and family member testing in nine (10.3%) patients. Unselected patients with SCLC were more likely to carry germline RAD51 paralog D (RAD51D), checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1), breast cancer 2 (BRCA2), and mutY DNA glycosylase (MUTYH) pathogenic variants than healthy controls. Germline genotype was significantly associated with the likelihood of a first-degree relative with cancer or lung cancer (odds ratio: 1.82, P = 0.008; and 2.60, P = 0.028), and longer recurrence-free survival after platinum-based chemotherapy (P = 0.002), independent of known prognostic factors. Treatment of a patient with relapsed SCLC and germline pathogenic mutation of BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1), a homologous recombination-related gene, using agents synthetically lethal with homologous recombination deficiency, resulted in a notable disease response. This work demonstrates that SCLC, currently thought to result almost exclusively from tobacco exposure, may have an inherited predisposition and lays the groundwork for targeted therapies based on the genes involved.

The landscape of genomic alterations across childhood cancers
Pan-cancer analyses that examine commonalities and differences among various cancer types have emerged as a powerful way to obtain novel insights into cancer biology. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genetic alterations in a pan-cancer cohort including 961 tumours from children, adolescents, and young adults, comprising 24 distinct molecular types of cancer. Using a standardized workflow, we identified marked differences in terms of mutation frequency and significantly mutated genes in comparison to previously analysed adult cancers. Genetic alterations in 149 putative cancer driver genes separate the tumours into two classes: small mutation and structural/copy-number variant (correlating with germline variants). Structural variants, hyperdiploidy, and chromothripsis are linked to TP53 mutation status and mutational signatures. Our data suggest that 7-8% of the children in this cohort carry an unambiguous predisposing germline variant and that nearly 50% of paediatric neoplasms harbour a potentially druggable event, which is highly relevant for the design of future clinical trials.

Identification of a comprehensive spectrum of genetic factors for hereditary breast cancer in a Chinese population by next-generation sequencing
The genetic etiology of hereditary breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. Although germline mutations of high-penetrance genes such as BRCA1/2 are implicated in development of hereditary breast cancers, at least half of all breast cancer families are not linked to these genes. To identify a comprehensive spectrum of genetic factors for hereditary breast cancer in a Chinese population, we performed an analysis of germline mutations in 2,165 coding exons of 152 genes associated with hereditary cancer using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 99 breast cancer patients from families of cancer patients regardless of cancer types. Forty-two deleterious germline mutations were identified in 21 genes of 34 patients, including 18 (18.2%) BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, 3 (3%) TP53 mutations, 5 (5.1%) DNA mismatch repair gene mutations, 1 (1%) CDH1 mutation, 6 (6.1%) Fanconi anemia pathway gene mutations, and 9 (9.1%) mutations in other genes. Of seven patients who carried mutations in more than one gene, 4 were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, and their average onset age was much younger than patients with only BRCA1/2 mutations. Almost all identified high-penetrance gene mutations in those families fulfill the typical phenotypes of hereditary cancer syndromes listed in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, except two TP53 and three mismatch repair gene mutations. Furthermore, functional studies of MSH3 germline mutations confirmed the association between MSH3 mutation and tumorigenesis, and segregation analysis suggested antagonism between BRCA1 and MSH3. We also identified a lot of low-penetrance gene mutations. Although the clinical significance of those newly identified low-penetrance gene mutations has not been fully appreciated yet, these new findings do provide valuable epidemiological information for the future studies. Together, these findings highlight the importance of genetic testing based on NCCN guidelines and a multi-gene analysis using NGS may be a supplement to traditional genetic counseling.

Rapid development of post-radiotherapy sarcoma and breast cancer in a patient with a novel germline 'de-novo' TP53 mutation
Aims:
        
      
      Germline mutations in the TP53 tumour suppressor gene are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which is characterised by a spectrum of neoplasms occurring in children and young adults that predominantly include early-onset breast cancer, a variety of sarcomas, brain tumours and adrenocortical tumours. The identification of patients carrying TP53 mutations is primarily based on a positive family history of these early-onset characteristic cancer types. The aim of this study is to emphasize the importance of TP53 molecular testing in patients with very early onset breast cancer and no family history of cancer.

Gene panel sequencing in familial breast/ovarian cancer patients identifies multiple novel mutations also in genes others than BRCA1/2
Breast and ovarian cancer (BC/OC) predisposition has been attributed to a number of high- and moderate to low-penetrance susceptibility genes. With the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) simultaneous testing of these genes has become feasible. In this monocentric study, we report results of panel-based screening of 14 BC/OC susceptibility genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, RAD51D, CHEK2, PALB2, ATM, NBN, CDH1, TP53, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) in a group of 581 consecutive individuals from a German population with BC and/or OC fulfilling diagnostic criteria for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing including 179 with a triple-negative tumor. Altogether we identified 106 deleterious mutations in 105 (18%) patients in 10 different genes, including seven different exon deletions. Of these 106 mutations, 16 (15%) were novel and only six were found in BRCA1/2. To further characterize mutations located in or nearby splicing consensus sites we performed RT-PCR analysis which allowed confirmation of pathogenicity in 7 of 9 mutations analyzed. In PALB2, we identified a deleterious variant in six cases. All but one were associated with early onset BC and a positive family history indicating that penetrance for PALB2 mutations is comparable to BRCA2. Overall, extended testing beyond BRCA1/2 identified a deleterious mutation in further 6% of patients. As a downside, 89 variants of uncertain significance were identified highlighting the need for comprehensive variant databases. In conclusion, panel testing yields more accurate information on genetic cancer risk than assessing BRCA1/2 alone and wide-spread testing will help improve penetrance assessment of variants in these risk genes.

Somatic TP53 mutation mosaicism in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
We present a girl who developed adrenocortical adenoma at the age of 1 year and osteosarcoma at the age of 5 years. There was no history of cancer in her parents and their relatives. However, both tumors were typical for the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), and the patient met criteria for germline TP53 mutation testing. A mutation in codon 282 (Arg282Trp) was identified in her blood lymphocyte genomic DNA. The substitution was found in neither of her parents, which indicated a possibility of a de novo mutation. Unexpectedly, sequencing of the DNA of the patient repeatedly showed allelic imbalance in favor of the normal allele. This observation prompted us to investigate the putative somatic mosaicism in the patient consisting of normal cells and cells heterozygous for the mutation. The imbalance was also examined in two other non-invasively sampled tissues, buccal cells, and cells from the urine sediment, and sequencing was confirmed with two other independent methods. While the findings in blood and the urine sediment were similar, in buccal cells both alleles were present in equal amounts. The allele ratio in lymphocytes was consistent with a mosaic where about 2/3 of cells carried two normal alleles and only 1/3 was heterozygous for the mutation. Despite the mosaicism the girl developed two early childhood tumors of mesodermal origin, and her phenotype was thus not milder than that of other germline TP53 mutation carriers. To our knowledge this is the first description of somatic mosaicism for a de novo TP53 mutation in LFS.

Initiation of human astrocytoma by clonal evolution of cells with progressive loss of p53 functions in a patient with a 283H TP53 germ-line mutation: evidence for a precursor lesion
Little is known about the genetic and molecular events leading to the early stages of human astrocytoma formation. To examine this issue, we analyzed the significance of sequential accumulation of two somatic point mutations (R267W and E258D) in the TP53 gene during the initiation of astrocytoma in a patient born with a single germ-line p53 point mutation (R283H). We adapted a p53 transcriptional assay in yeast to establish the temporal occurrence and allelic distribution of the p53 mutations present in the patient and characterized these mutations through functional assays and structural modeling. Our results show that the first somatic mutation occurred at codon 267 on the p53 allele harboring the germ-line mutation R283H, whereas the second somatic mutation occurred in the remaining wild-type (wt) allele at codon 258. These two mutations induced the formation of tumor cells with the genotype p53(267W+283H/258D), which comprised 70% of the cells in the primary WHO grade II astrocytoma. Another 8% of cells within the tumor had the partially mutated genotype p53(267W+283H/WT) and represented the remnants of a clinically undetectable intermediate stage of astrocytic neoplastic transformation. The remaining 22% of cells had the constitutive p53(283H/WT) genotype and likely consisted of nontumor cells. Functional analysis of the p53 alleles present in the patient's tumor indicated that the germ-line p53(R283H) could transactivate the CDKN1A((p21, WAF1, cip1, SDI1)) but not the BAX gene and retained the ability to induce growth arrest of human glioblastoma cells. The p53(R267W+R283H) and p53(E258D) were incapable of transactivating either promoter or inducing growth arrest. Modeling of p53 interaction with DNA suggests that R283H mutation may weaken the sequence-specific interaction of p53 lysine 120 with the BAX gene but not the CDKN1A p53-responsive elements. Taken together, these results have characterized, for the first time, the genetic events defining a clinically undetectable precursor lesion leading to a grade II astrocytoma. They also suggest that astrocytoma initiation in this patient resulted from monoclonal evolution driven by a sequential loss of proapoptotic and growth arrest functions of p53.

A targeted sequencing panel identifies rare damaging variants in multiple genes in the cranial neural tube defect, anencephaly
Neural tube defects (NTDs) affecting the brain (anencephaly) are lethal before or at birth, whereas lower spinal defects (spina bifida) may lead to lifelong neurological handicap. Collectively, NTDs rank among the most common birth defects worldwide. This study focuses on anencephaly, which despite having a similar frequency to spina bifida and being the most common type of NTD observed in mouse models, has had more limited inclusion in genetic studies. A genetic influence is strongly implicated in determining risk of NTDs and a molecular diagnosis is of fundamental importance to families both in terms of understanding the origin of the condition and for managing future pregnancies. Here we used a custom panel of 191 NTD candidate genes to screen 90 patients with cranial NTDs (n = 85 anencephaly and n = 5 craniorachischisis) with a targeted exome sequencing platform. After filtering and comparing to our in-house control exome database (N = 509), we identified 397 rare variants (minor allele frequency, MAF < 1%), 21 of which were previously unreported and predicted damaging. This included 1 frameshift (PDGFRA), 2 stop-gained (MAT1A; NOS2) and 18 missense variations. Together with evidence for oligogenic inheritance, this study provides new information on the possible genetic causation of anencephaly.

Two cases of osteosarcoma occurring as second malignancy of childhood cancer
We report on two patients in whom osteosarcoma occurred as second malignancy of childhood cancer. One patient had a malignant teratoma and the other adrenocortical carcinoma as the primary cancer. The emergence of cancer in cured cases and long-term survival cases of childhood cancer may result in an increase in the number of osteosarcomas seen in adolescence occurring as second malignancy. Anti-cancer drugs in large does were used for the treatment of a malignant teratoma in the former. These anti-cancer drugs may be involved in the occurrence of the second malignancy. In the latter, the patient has the germ-line mutation of p53 tumor suppressor gene, so genetic factors are presumably related to the occurrence of the second malignancy.

Identification of a novel TP53 germline mutation E285V in a rare case of paediatric adrenocortical carcinoma and choroid plexus carcinoma
Paediatric choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) and adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) are exceedingly rare tumours, each occurring at an annual rate of 0.3 cases per million children or less. Although both tumour types are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), the penetrance of germline TP53 mutations in CPC remains to be established. We report here a young boy without a family history of cancer who presented with CPC and subsequently ACC. Genetic testing revealed a novel de novo germline TP53 mutation (E285V). Neither tumour underwent loss of heterozygosity. Consistent with this observation, functional analyses demonstrated that E285V acts as a dominant negative mutant that is defective in regulating target gene expression, growth suppression and apoptosis. These results further strengthen the association between germline TP53 mutations and childhood CPC, even when occurring in the absence of familial tumour susceptibility.

Detection of novel germ-line p53 mutations in diverse-cancer-prone families identified by selecting patients with childhood adrenocortical carcinoma
Background:
        
      
      Germ-line p53 mutations appear to be inherited among the members of families diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). The mutations detected in those families to date have been clustered in exon 7 of the p53 gene and, typically, have been single-base substitutions resulting in amino acid changes.

Chest wall leiomyosarcoma after breast-conservative therapy for early-stage breast cancer in a young woman with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is one of the most penetrant forms of familial cancer susceptibility syndromes, characterized by early age at tumor onset and a wide spectrum of malignant tumors. Identifying LFS in patients with cancer is clinically imperative because they have an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and are more likely to develop radiation-induced secondary malignancies. This case report describes a young woman whose initial presentation of LFS was early-onset breast cancer and whose treatment of this primary malignancy with breast conservation likely resulted in a secondary malignancy arising in her radiation field. As seen in this case, most breast cancers in patients with LFS exhibit a triple-positive phenotype (estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/HER2-positive). Although this patient met classic LFS criteria based on age and personal and family history of cancer, the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian Cancer endorse genetic screening for TP53 mutations in a subset of patients with early-onset breast cancer, even in the absence of a suggestive family history, because of the potential for de novo TP53 mutations.

A TP53-truncating germline mutation (E287X) in a family with characteristics of both hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Mutations in CDH1, which encodes E-cadherin, have been associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) in Western populations but have not been shown to play a major role in Asians. Recently, a patient with familial gastric cancer (FGC) was shown to harbor a germline mutation in the TP53 gene, which encodes p53 and has been previously associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS). To determine whether mutations in TP53 are associated with FGC in Asians, we screened the entire coding region of TP53 in probands from 23 Korean FGC families. We identified a nonsense (E287X) TP53 germline mutation in a family whose history is compatible with both HDGC and LFS. Two members of this family (SNU-G2) were afflicted with brain tumors, seven with gastric cancers, two with sarcomas, and one with both gastric cancer and a sarcoma. The E287X TP53 mutation segregated with the cancer phenotype in the family members from whom DNA samples were available. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a large family with both HDGC and LFS. Our results suggest that TP53 mutational screening in FGC families should be interpreted with caution because additional TP53 mutation-carrying HDGC families may also show LFS-related phenotypes.

Germline TP53 Mutation and Clinical Characteristics of Korean Patients With Li-Fraumeni Syndrome
Background:
        
      
      Little is known of the mutation and tumor spectrum of Korean patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Owing to the rarity of LFS, few cases have been reported in Korea thus far. This study aimed to retrospectively review the mutations and clinical characteristics of Korean patients with LFS.

Molecular Diagnosis of Mosaic Overgrowth Syndromes Using a Custom-Designed Next-Generation Sequencing Panel
Recent studies have discovered a group of overgrowth syndromes, such as congenital lipomatous overgrowth with vascular, epidermal, and skeletal anomalies (CLOVES) syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria (MCAP) syndrome, are caused by somatic activating variants in genes involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway. Because of the low-abundance nature of these variants, Sanger sequencing often yields negative results. We have developed and validated a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel that targets all known variants associated with these syndromes. Fifty cases, including two prenatal cases, were tested using the panel. A pathogenic variant in the PIK3CA, PIK3R2, or AKT1 gene was identified in 28 of the 50 cases with the variant allele frequencies ranging from 1.0% to 49.2%. These variants were only present in the affected tissues in most of the cases, demonstrating a causal role in the development of these diseases. In vitro cell culture showed significant enrichment of the cells harboring variant alleles, suggesting that these variants render growth advantages to mutant cells. Phenotype-genotype correlation analysis showed PIK3CA mutation hotspots at residues E542, E545, and H1047 are often associated with CLOVES syndrome, whereas PIK3CA G914R is preferentially related to MCAP. We thus demonstrate that NGS technology is highly sensitive for detecting low-level mosaicism and can facilitate clinical diagnosis of mosaic overgrowth syndromes in both prenatal and postnatal settings.

p53 compound heterozygosity in a severely affected child with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare, dominantly inherited syndrome that features high risk of cancers in childhood and early adulthood. Affected families tend to develop bone and soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors, leukemias, and adrenocortical carcinomas. In some kindreds, the genetic abnormality associated with this cancer phenotype is a heterozygous germline mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Recently, we identified one patient who presented in early childhood with multiple primary cancers and who harbored three germline p53 alterations (R156H and R267Q on the maternal allele and R290H on the paternal allele). To classify the biologic effects of these alterations, functional properties of each of the p53 mutants were examined using in vitro assays of cellular growth suppression and transcriptional activation. Each amino acid substitution conferred partial or complete loss of wild-type p53 function, but the child completed normal embryonic development. This observation has not been previously reported in a human, but is consistent with observations of normal embryogenesis in p53-deficient mice.

Hereditary TP53 codon 292 and somatic P16INK4A codon 94 mutations in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by various types of cancer in childhood and adult cases. Although hereditary TP53 mutation is very rare in different human cancers, it has been frequently reported in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. On the other hand, hereditary mutations of TP57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A, which affect the cell cycle similar to TP53, were observed in some types of cancer. In a Turkish family with the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, we analyzed the mutation pattern of TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A in the peripheral blood, and loss of heterozygosity (homo/hemizygous deletion) pattern of TP53 and P15INK4B/P16INK4A in two tumor tissues. The propositus had a seminoma, his daughter a medulloblastoma, and one of his healthy cousins, a TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation (AAA-->ATA; Lys-->Ile) in the peripheral blood cells. Tumor tissue obtained from the propositus with the seminoma revealed loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene. In the analyses of tumor tissues from the propositus and his daughter, a P16INK4A codon 94 missense point mutation (GCG-->GAG; Ala-->Glu) was observed with the hereditary TP53 mutation. P16INK4A codon 94 mutation observed in our family is a novel mutation in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. No other gene alteration in TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A was observed. Existence of the P16INK4A mutation and the hereditary TP53 mutation with or without loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene (seminoma/medulloblastoma) may be evidence for a common mechanism involved in tumorogenesis. The gene alterations in TP53 and P16INK4A genes may be used as tumor markers in our family.

Spitzoid melanoma in a child with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Spitzoid melanoma of childhood is a rare malignancy. The histological features are at the upper end of a range encompassing Spitz nevus and atypical Spitz tumor, the unifying features including large oval, fusiform or polygonal melanocytes with abundant homogeneous-appearing cytoplasma and large vesicular nuclei. The presence of a "bottom-heavy" pattern, strikingly enlarged nuclei and nucleoli in both the upper and lower portions of the lesion, and deep mitotic figures are among the findings that distinguish most of the Spitzoid melanomas from Spitz nevi and atypical Spitz tumors. There are no syndromic associations reported for this malignancy. We report the occurrence of choroid plexus carcinoma, Spitzoid melanoma, and myelodysplasia in a child who was found to carry a germline mutation for TP53. While choroid plexus carcinoma and myelodysplasia have relatively frequently been described, melanomas have been very rarely described in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The association of Spitzoid melanoma with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, especially in a pediatric patient, has not been reported before.

Germline p53 mutations in a cohort with childhood sarcoma: sex differences in cancer risk
To characterize cancer risk in heterozygous p53 mutation carriers, we analyzed cancer incidence in 56 germline p53 mutation carriers and 3,201 noncarriers from 107 kindreds ascertained through patients with childhood soft-tissue sarcoma who were treated at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. We systematically followed members in these kindreds for cancer incidence for >20 years and evaluated their p53 gene status. We found seven kindreds with germline p53 mutations that include both missense and truncation mutation types. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed similar cancer risks between 21 missense and 35 truncation p53 mutation carriers (log-rank chi(2)=0.04; P=.84). We found a significantly higher cancer risk in female carriers than in male carriers (log-rank chi(2)=12.1; P<.001), a difference not explained by an excess of sex-specific cancer. The calculated standardized incidence ratio (SIR) showed that mutation carriers had a risk for all types of cancer that was much higher than that for the general population (SIR = 41.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 29.9-55.0) whereas noncarriers had a risk for all types of cancer that was similar to that in the general population (SIR = 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.0). The calculated SIRs showed a >100-fold higher risk of sarcoma, female breast cancer, and hematologic malignancies for the p53 mutation carriers and agreed with the findings of an earlier segregation analysis based on the same cohort. These results quantitatively illustrated the spectrum of cancer risk in germline p53 mutation carriers and will provide valuable reference for the evaluation and treatment of patients with cancer.

Prevalence of TP53 germ line mutations in young Pakistani breast cancer patients
Women from Pakistan and India are more often diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer than Caucasian women. Given that only 12% of Pakistani women diagnosed with breast cancer at or before 30 years of age have previously been shown to harbor germ line mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, the genetic causes of the majority of early-onset cases are unexplained. Since germ line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 predispose women to early-onset breast cancer, we assessed the prevalence of TP53 mutations in 105 early-onset breast cancer patients from Pakistan, who had previously been found to be negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ line mutations. The patient group included 67 women diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer at or before age 30 with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer (EO30NFH group) and 38 women diagnosed with breast cancer at or before age 40 with one or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer (EO40FH group). Mutation analysis of the complete TP53 coding region was performed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, followed by DNA sequencing of variant fragments. One deleterious mutation, c.499-500delCA in exon 5, was identified in the 105 breast cancer patients (1%). This mutation is novel in the germ line and has not been described in other populations. It was detected in a 28-year-old patient with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. This mutation is rare as it was not detected in additional 157 recently recruited non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2-associated early-onset breast cancer patients. Our findings show that TP53 mutations may account for a minimal portion of early-onset breast cancer in Pakistan.

A chronic myeloid leukemia-like syndrome case with del (12) (p12) in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a familial cancer syndrome characterized by different tumors and hereditary p53 mutations. Here, a chronic myeloid leukemia-like syndrome case in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family with del (12) (p12) cytogenetic abnormality was presented. A hereditary p53 mutation (pro309ser) supported the Li-Fraumeni syndrome diagnosis in this family. This syndrome was characterized by the clonal myeloproliferative accumulation in bone marrow and peripheral blood with negative bcr/abl gene rearrangement finding. The etiology of this rare syndrome is still unclear. This is the only chronic myeloid leukemia-like syndrome case reported in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. Del (12)(p12) was observed in leukemias except chronic myeloid leukemia-like syndrome. The deletion in chromosome 12p12 with hereditary p53 mutation should have a critical role in chronic myeloid leukemia-like syndrome etiology in our case.

Multiple rare variants in high-risk pancreatic cancer-related genes may increase risk for pancreatic cancer in a subset of patients with and without germline CDKN2A mutations
The risk of pancreatic cancer (PC) is increased in melanoma-prone families but the causal relationship between germline CDKN2A mutations and PC risk is uncertain, suggesting the existence of non-CDKN2A factors. One genetic possibility involves patients having mutations in multiple high-risk PC-related genes; however, no systematic examination has yet been conducted. We used next-generation sequencing data to examine 24 putative PC-related genes in 43 PC patients with and 23 PC patients without germline CDKN2A mutations and 1001 controls. For each gene and the four pathways in which they occurred, we tested whether PC patients (overall or CDKN2A+ and CDKN2A- cases separately) had an increased number of rare nonsynonymous variants. Overall, we identified 35 missense variants in PC patients, 14 in CDKN2A+ and 21 in CDKN2A- PC cases. We found nominally significant associations for mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) in all PC patients and for ATM, CPA1, and PMS2 in CDKN2A- PC patients. Further, nine CDKN2A+ and four CDKN2A- PC patients had rare potentially deleterious variants in multiple PC-related genes. Loss-of-function variants were only observed in CDKN2A- PC patients, with ATM having the most pathogenic variants. Also, ATM variants (n = 5) were only observed in CDKN2A- PC patients with a family history that included digestive system tumors. Our results suggest that a subset of PC patients may have increased risk because of germline mutations in multiple PC-related genes.

Targeted germline sequencing of patients with three or more primary melanomas reveals high rate of pathogenic variants
Individuals with multiple primary melanomas have rates of germline CDKN2A pathogenic variants of 3%-18%, and are also frequent carriers of variants in the melanocortin-1 receptor. Few patients with numerous (â¥3) primary melanomas have been studied with respect to these or other potential germline pathogenic variants. We investigated 46 patients with â¥3 primary melanomas (3, n = 17; 4, n = 14; 5-14, n = 15) to determine if higher rates of germline pathogenic variants of CDKN2A, MC1R, or other cancer genes could explain their extreme melanoma phenotype. Most (43/46, 93%) patients had variants in MC1R and 11/46 (24%) had CDKN2A pathogenic variants, but only male sex and having two variants in MC1R correlated with increasing number of melanomas. Panel screening of 56 other cancer predisposition genes did not reveal other germline pathogenic variants associated with melanoma (CDK4, BAP1, POT1), although pathogenic variants in TP53, CHEK2, and BRCA2 were present in three separate patients and some patients had variants of uncertain significance. In summary, targeted germline sequencing of patients with â¥3 primary melanomas revealed a high rate of pathogenic variants in CDKN2A and other known cancer genes. Although further investigation of these pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance is needed, these results support cancer gene panel testing in individuals diagnosed with â¥3 melanomas.

Integrated analysis of germline and somatic variants in ovarian cancer
We report the first large-scale exome-wide analysis of the combined germline-somatic landscape in ovarian cancer. Here we analyse germline and somatic alterations in 429 ovarian carcinoma cases and 557 controls. We identify 3,635 high confidence, rare truncation and 22,953 missense variants with predicted functional impact. We find germline truncation variants and large deletions across Fanconi pathway genes in 20% of cases. Enrichment of rare truncations is shown in BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2. In addition, we observe germline truncation variants in genes not previously associated with ovarian cancer susceptibility (NF1, MAP3K4, CDKN2B and MLL3). Evidence for loss of heterozygosity was found in 100 and 76% of cases with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 truncations, respectively. Germline-somatic interaction analysis combined with extensive bioinformatics annotation identifies 222 candidate functional germline truncation and missense variants, including two pathogenic BRCA1 and 1 TP53 deleterious variants. Finally, integrated analyses of germline and somatic variants identify significantly altered pathways, including the Fanconi, MAPK and MLL pathways.

Multifocal intrafollicular granulosa cell tumor of the ovary associated with an unusual germline p53 mutation
A 23-year-old woman presented with a 7 cm right multicystic mass in the ovary, which corresponded microscopically to an unusual lesion consisting of a multifocal granulosa cell tumor with intrafollicular ('in situ') growth involving two-thirds of mature follicles. Stromal invasion was found in only one area where neoplastic follicles coalesced. Granulosa cells had atypical, bizarre TP53 positive nuclei with hyperchromatism, abundant mitoses and numerous hyaline globules. The contralateral ovary was normal. From the age of 10 years, the patient had a complex medical history of multiple tumors, including telangiectatic osteosarcoma, typical and malignant phyllodes tumor, reticulohistiocytoma of skin, carcinomas of the breast and lipo- and leiomyosarcoma. The female genital tract also harbored myometrial leiomyomas and an early endometrial carcinoma. Retrospective histologic study of all mesenchymal neoplasms in this patient showed, the conspicuous presence of similar bizarre TP53 positive cells with hyaline globules in all the mesenchymal neoplasms. In the genetic study, a germline p53 gene mutation was detected in exon 10, codon 336, generating a stop codon in the oligomerization domain of the protein (E336X). A further p53 mutation was found in exon 7 in the granulosa cell tumor. Mutation occurred de novo since there was no history of tumors in any family members, all of whom had a wild-type p53. Although this patient shows a typical tumor phenotype of Li Fraumeni syndrome, the germline mutation corresponded to a highly unusual mutated domain, which is similar to the one found in childhood malignant adrenocortical tumor; also a rare neoplasm that originates in adrenocortical cells; which are closely related, both functionally and embryologically, to granulosa cells.

Two functional assays employed to detect an unusual mutation in the oligomerisation domain of p53 in a Li-Fraumeni like family
Previous investigations of a Li - Fraumeni like family (Barnes et al., 1992) demonstrated that both the proband and her mother had elevated p53 protein levels in both tumour tissue and normal tissue at sites distant from the tumour, although no mutation was found in the p53 gene. In the present study two recently described functional assays for p53, an apoptotic assay and the functional assay for the separation of alleles in yeast (FASAY), have been employed to study the functional activity of p53 from this patient. The results of the apoptotic assay demonstrated that this patient had a p53 functional defect and the FASAY result suggested that this defect was in fact a germline mutation of the p53 gene. A point mutation of codon 337, which results in an amino acid substitution of a cysteine for an arginine, was demonstrated initially in cDNA and was confirmed by sequencing of genomic DNA. This is an unusual mutation as it is in the oligomerisation domain of p53, in contrast to the majority of p53 mutations which are in the core DNA binding domain. This mutation results in a protein which still retains partial transactivational activity in the FASAY. The mutation of codon 337 is only the second reported case of a germline missense mutation occurring in the oligomerisation domain of p53.

Characterization of the oligomerization defects of two p53 mutants found in families with Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome
Recently two germline mutations in the oligomerization domain of p53 have been identified in patients with Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like Syndromes. We have used biophysical and biochemical methods to characterize these two mutants in order to better understand their functional defects and the role of the p53 oligomerization domain (residues 325-355) in oncogenesis. We find that residues 310-360 of the L344P mutant are monomeric, apparently unfolded and cannot interact with wild-type (WT) p53. The full length L344P protein is unable to bind sequence specifically to DNA and is therefore an inactive, but not a dominant negative mutant. R337C, on the other hand, can form dimers and tetramers, can hetero-oligomerize with WTp53 and can bind to a p53 consensus element. However, the thermal stability of R337C is much lower than that of WTp53 and at physiological temperatures more than half of this mutant is less than tetrameric. Thus, the R337C mutant retains some functional activity yet leads to a predisposition to cancer, suggesting that even partial inactivation of p53 oligomerization is sufficient for accelerated tumour progression.

A novel mechanism of tumorigenesis involving pH-dependent destabilization of a mutant p53 tetramer
The p53 tumor suppressor requires tetramerization to function as an initiator of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Children in southern Brazil that exhibit an elevated incidence of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) harbor an Arg 337 to His mutation within the tetramerization domain of p53 (p53-R337H; 35 of 36 patients). The mutant tetramerization domain (p53tet-R337H) adopts a native-like fold but is less stable than the wild type domain (p53tet-wt). Furthermore, the stability of p53tet-R337H is highly sensitive to pH in the physiological range; this sensitivity correlates with the protonation state of the mutated His 337. These results demonstrate a pH-sensitive molecular defect of p53 (R337H), suggesting that pH-dependent p53 dysfunction is the molecular basis for these cases of ACC in Brazilian children.

Penetrance of adrenocortical tumours associated with the germline TP53 R337H mutation
Background:
        
      
      An inherited germline P53 mutation has been identified in cases of childhood adrenocortical carcinoma (ACT), a neoplasm with a high incidence in southern Brazil. The penetrance of ACT in carriers of the point mutation, which encodes an arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 337 of TP53 (R337H), has not been determined.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome in a Turkish family
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is one of the familial cancers characterized by different tumors and hereditary TP53 mutations. The adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) association with acute leukemia is unusual in childhood, even in LFS. The authors here present a family with pR337P mutation in TP53 gene who had a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and associated adrenocortical carcinoma as a case 1 and his cousin with brain tumor as a case 2. A hereditary TP53 mutation supported the diagnosis of LFS in this family. The patients had many difficulties in treatment strategies and succumbed to death. The availability of a reliable molecular marker to detect the R337P TP53 mutation allows the rapid identification of carriers in families that have a child with ACC. Once identified, carriers could be screened for early detection of ACC by imaging and endocrine studies and should be given psychological support to prevent anxiety for death. Whether early detection of ACC will reduce the mortality in these patients remains to be determined.

A novel TP53 germline inframe deletion identified in a Spanish series of Li-fraumeni syndrome suspected families
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant, inherited tumor predisposition syndrome associated with heterozygous germline mutations in the TP53 gene. The molecular diagnosis of LFS is important to develop strategies for early detection and access to the genetic counseling. Our study evaluated germline TP53 mutations in Spanish families with a history suggestive of LFS. Germline TP53 alterations in 22 families with a history suggestive of LFS were evaluated by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Loss of heterozygosity analysis and immunohistochemistry of the protein in the tumor were performed in order to evaluate the pathogenicity of a novel alteration detected. A total of seven TP53 mutations were detected, six point mutations (4 missense and 2 nonsense) and a novel inframe deletion. 93% of mutation carriers developed at least one malignancy (mainly breast cancer and sarcomas), with a mean age at diagnosis of the first tumor of 30.2 years. Two missense mutations acted as dominant-negative. The novel inframe mutation c.437_445del was located in the DNA-binding domain. This mutation segregated with cancer in the family, and both high expression of the protein and loss of the wild-type TP53 allele were detected in the tumor of the carrier. We have found a novel inframe deletion in TP53 that likely results in the loss of p53 function and acts in a non-dominant negative way, although further studies are necessary to clarify this issue. The identification of novel TP53 alterations is crucial for a personalized cancer-risk management of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

p53 Tetramerization domain mutations: germline R342X and R342P, and somatic R337G identified in pediatric patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and a child with adrenocortical carcinoma
Germline p53 mutations are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and other familial cancer phenotypes not fulfilling the definition for LFS. The majority of germline p53 mutations cluster in exons 5-8, corresponding to a DNA binding domain. We report the identification of two germline mutations and a somatic mutation in a tetramerization domain (TD), a rare site for mutations. The germline mutation, R342X (16915C>T), and the novel mutation, R342P (16916G>C), were found in a child with adrenocortical carcinoma and in a LFS pediatric patient with multiple primaries. The novel somatic mutation, R337G (16900C>G), was discovered in myelodysplastic syndrome with transformation to acute myeloblastic leukemia, developing as the third primary in the LFS child. These findings add further information on p53 TD mutations and TD contribution to tumorigenesis.

p53 mutants without a functional tetramerisation domain are not oncogenic
p53 is altered in about 50 % of cancers. Most of the p53 mutants have lost the wild-type tumour suppressor activity but show oncogenic properties. The majority of the p53 alterations are missense mutations of residues located in its DNA binding domain (DBD). Only a few mutations concern residues in its tetramerisation domain (TD). However, the study of mutant proteins identified in tumors that do not form tetramers has shown that they have lost the wild-type activity like most of the p53 DBD mutants. Here, we show that two of such mutant proteins, Arg342Pro and Leu344Pro are not dominant negative and do not stimulate the expression of a reporter gene under the control of the multi-drug resistance gene-1 (MDR-1). This suggests that to be oncogenic, p53 mutants need to form tetramers. Accordingly, the dominant negative effect and the ability of a tetrameric mutant protein, Asp281Gly, to stimulate the MDR-1 promoter are abolished when its TD is rendered non-functional by the mutation of leucine 344 to a proline residue. These results suggest that mutations in the TD, are less selected in tumors than mutations in the DBD because they do not lead to oncogenic proteins.

Further evidence for pathogenicity of the TP53 tetramerization domain mutation p.Arg342Pro in Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare genetic disease with a highly significant predisposition to multiple early-onset neoplasms. These neoplasms include adrenocortical carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia and CNS tumors in children and sarcoma, breast cancer and lung cancer in adults. LFS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In most patients germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are found. As the majority of known mutations affect the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein, there are only a few case reports showing the clinical presentation of mutations outside of this mutational hotspot. Here we present a family with a typical LFS pedigree with patients suffering from early-onset lung cancer, bilateral breast cancer and osteosarcoma. TP53 sequence analysis of the index patient revealed the germline mutation c.1025G > C in a heterozygous state, resulting in an amino acid exchange from arginine to proline (p.Arg342Pro) in the tetramerization domain of p53. Using DNA from an old bedside blood typing test, the same mutation was found in the mother of the index patient, who had died of breast cancer 29 years ago. In conclusion, we provide evidence for the co-segregation of a TP53 tetramerization domain mutation and cancer phenotypes, but also report pre-symptomatic mutation carriers within the family. We review published recommendations for clinical management and surveillance of high-risk members in Li-Fraumeni kindreds.

Increased sperm aneuploidy in two male carriers of germline TP53 mutations
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a broad spectrum of tumors. The disorder is caused by germline mutations in the TP53 gene. We studied chromosomes in the sperm of two male carriers of TP53 mutations. We observed increased sperm aneuploidy, mainly concerning the gonosomes when compared to four normal male controls. This observation may correlate with the involvement of the p53 protein in spermatogenesis, with its role in aneuploidy in cancer, and with the occurrence of two cases of Turner syndrome in families with germline TP53 mutations reported in the literature.

8649785
A previously undescribed mutation within the tetramerisation domain of TP53 in a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
We report details of a family with classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome in which there is a mutation in codon 344 of the tumour suppressor gene TP53. Codon 344 is a key residue within the tetramerisation domain, and the amino acid substitution of a proline for a leucine is predicted to have profound implications for tetramerisation and potentially DNA binding. This is the first report of a mutation at this residue in either sporadic tumours or in the germline and the first report of a germline mutation within the tetramerisation domain. The family does not appear to be remarkable in the spectrum of tumours, and there is loss of the wild-type allele in a leiomyosarcoma from the proband. A cell line has been established from the tumour of the proband and cytogenetic and molecular studies carried out, providing an extensive analysis in this family.

Tumor genomic profiling and TP53 germline mutation analysis of first-degree relative familial gliomas
About 5% of gliomas occur in a familial context, which suggests a genetic origin, but the predisposing molecular factors remain unknown in most cases. A series of nine familial gliomas were characterized with 1-megabase resolution BAC array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) together with germline sequence analysis of TP53. This series was compared with a literature series of familial gliomas and a personal series of sporadic gliomas, analyzed by chromosome CGH and aCGH, respectively. No significant difference was noted between the three populations in terms of clinical characteristics, pathologic features, and the most frequent chromosomal alterations, including loss of 1p, 10p, 10q, 13q, and 19q, and gain of 7p, 7q, 16p, 18q, 19p, 19q, 20p, and 22q. However, a genomic region located in 6q was more frequently gained in our series of familial as compared to sporadic gliomas (P=0.028). A germline TP53 mutation was observed in 1/9 cases, which suggests Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Interestingly, the Pro allele in the codon 72 of TP53 was observed in 5/9 tumors. Although familial and sporadic gliomas share very similar cytogenetic quantitative patterns, aCGH is a promising technique for the detection of small genomic differences of potential significance.

A landscape of germ line mutations in a cohort of inherited bone marrow failure patients
Bone marrow (BM) failure (BMF) in children and young adults is often suspected to be inherited, but in many cases diagnosis remains uncertain. We studied a cohort of 179 patients (from 173 families) with BMF of suspected inherited origin but unresolved diagnosis after medical evaluation and Fanconi anemia exclusion. All patients had cytopenias, and 12.0% presented â¥5% BM blast cells. Median age at genetic evaluation was 11 years; 20.7% of patients were aged â¤2 years and 36.9% were â¥18 years. We analyzed genomic DNA from skin fibroblasts using whole-exome sequencing, and were able to assign a causal or likely causal germ line mutation in 86 patients (48.0%), involving a total of 28 genes. These included genes in familial hematopoietic disorders (GATA2, RUNX1), telomeropathies (TERC, TERT, RTEL1), ribosome disorders (SBDS, DNAJC21, RPL5), and DNA repair deficiency (LIG4). Many patients had an atypical presentation, and the mutated gene was often not clinically suspected. We also found mutations in genes seldom reported in inherited BMF (IBMF), such as SAMD9 and SAMD9L (N = 16 of the 86 patients, 18.6%), MECOM/EVI1 (N = 6, 7.0%), and ERCC6L2 (N = 7, 8.1%), each of which was associated with a distinct natural history; SAMD9 and SAMD9L patients often experienced transient aplasia and monosomy 7, whereas MECOM patients presented early-onset severe aplastic anemia, and ERCC6L2 patients, mild pancytopenia with myelodysplasia. This study broadens the molecular and clinical portrait of IBMF syndromes and sheds light on newly recognized disease entities. Using a high-throughput sequencing screen to implement precision medicine at diagnosis can improve patient management and family counseling.

Novel p53 splice site mutations in three families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Germline mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene predispose to a variety of cancers in families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Most germline p53 mutations observed to date cause amino acid substitutions in the protein's central sequence-specific DNA binding domain. Outside this conserved core region, however, we found novel alterations in sequences that regulate precursor mRNA splicing in three Li-Fraumeni syndrome families. Two splice site mutations affected the consensus sequence at the splice donor sites of introns 1 and 9, and produced unstable variant transcripts in normal cells. A third mutation at the splice acceptor site of intron 9 generated splicing at a cryptic acceptor site in intron 9. These splice site alterations emphasize the need to examine both noncoding and untranslated regions of the p53 gene for germline mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome families.

Identification of Medically Actionable Secondary Findings in the 1000 Genomes
The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends that clinical sequencing laboratories return secondary findings in 56 genes associated with medically actionable conditions. Our goal was to apply a systematic, stringent approach consistent with clinical standards to estimate the prevalence of pathogenic variants associated with such conditions using a diverse sequencing reference sample. Candidate variants in the 56 ACMG genes were selected from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes dataset, which contains sequencing information on 1,092 unrelated individuals from across the world. These variants were filtered using the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) Professional version and defined parameters, appraised through literature review, and examined by a clinical laboratory specialist and expert physician. Over 70,000 genetic variants were extracted from the 56 genes, and filtering identified 237 variants annotated as disease causing by HGMD Professional. Literature review and expert evaluation determined that 7 of these variants were pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Furthermore, 5 additional truncating variants not listed as disease causing in HGMD Professional were identified as likely pathogenic. These 12 secondary findings are associated with diseases that could inform medical follow-up, including cancer predisposition syndromes, cardiac conditions, and familial hypercholesterolemia. The majority of the identified medically actionable findings were in individuals from the European (5/379) and Americas (4/181) ancestry groups, with fewer findings in Asian (2/286) and African (1/246) ancestry groups. Our results suggest that medically relevant secondary findings can be identified in approximately 1% (12/1092) of individuals in a diverse reference sample. As clinical sequencing laboratories continue to implement the ACMG recommendations, our results highlight that at least a small number of potentially important secondary findings can be selected for return. Our results also confirm that understudied populations will not reap proportionate benefits of genomic medicine, highlighting the need for continued research efforts on genetic diseases in these populations.

Characterization of germline TP53 splicing mutations and their genetic and functional analysis
Germline TP53 splicing mutations have been described infrequently (>2%) in the literature, however in a series of 40 patients and families identified by our group in which there are germline TP53 mutations, seven affect splicing (18%). The low figure reported in the literature might reflect the method of mutation detection, which in many studies does not include all splice junctions. These data indicate that a significant proportion of TP53 germline mutations are currently unrecognized. We have carried out detailed studies of the effects of the different mutations on splicing, and see distinct variations in the effects of the same mutation in different patients. Furthermore we have identified the usage of a non-consensus splice donor site in four families with an intron 4 splice donor mutation.

Detection of Germline Mutation in Hereditary Breast and/or Ovarian Cancers by Next-Generation Sequencing on a Four-Gene Panel
Mutation in BRCA1/BRCA2 genes accounts for 20% of familial breast cancers, 5% to 10% of which may be due to other less penetrant genes which are still incompletely studied. Herein, a four-gene panel was used to examine the prevalence of BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and PTEN in hereditary breast and ovarian cancers in Southern Chinese population. In this cohort, 948 high-risk breast and/or ovarian patients were recruited for genetic screening by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The performance of our NGS pipeline was evaluated with 80 Sanger-validated known mutations and eight negative cases. With appropriate bioinformatics analysis pipeline, the detection sensitivity of NGS is comparable with Sanger sequencing. The prevalence of BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations was 9.4% in our Chinese cohort, of which 48.8% of the mutations arose from hotspot mutations. With the use of a tailor-made algorithm, HomopolymerQZ, more mutations were detected compared with single mutation detection algorithm. The frequencies of PTEN and TP53 were 0.21% and 0.53%, respectively, in the Southern Chinese patients with breast and/or ovarian cancers. High-throughput NGS approach allows the incorporation of control cohort that provides an ethnicity-specific data for polymorphic variants. Our data suggest that hotspot mutations screening such as SNaPshot could be an effective preliminary screening alternative adopted in a standard clinical laboratory without NGS setup.

Germ-line splicing mutation of the p53 gene in a cancer-prone family
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant susceptibility to a variety of cancers including carcinomas of the breast and the adrenal cortex, tumors of brain and muscle tissue, and leukemias. Affected individuals develop cancer at a young age and often at multiple primary sites. A study has been conducted into the genetic basis of cancer in a particular Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. Examination of p53 as a candidate susceptibility gene revealed that, in two affected individuals, there was an aberrant larger transcript of 3.6 kilobases present in both tumor and constitutional material in addition to the normal-sized 2.8-kilobase transcript. The additional transcript was not found in three unaffected family members. S1 nuclease mapping localized the insertion toward the 5' end of the p53 transcript near exons 4 and 5, and sequencing revealed a point mutation in the splice donor site of intron 4 in the germ-line of the two affected individuals, which accounted for the presence of the larger transcript. The same splicing mutation was also detected in two obligate carriers and was not found in two unaffected individuals. As no mutations were detected in exons 5-8 in either tumor examined, the second p53 allele was most likely lost during tumorigenesis in both tumors. The demonstration of a germ-line splicing mutation in affected individuals from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family provides for a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation not seen previously in other affected families, in whom the mutations have all been missense.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Population-based estimate of the contribution of TP53 mutations to subgroups of early-onset breast cancer: Australian Breast Cancer Family Study
Although germline TP53 mutations have been identified in women with breast cancer from families meeting Li-Fraumeni criteria, their contribution to breast cancer per se is not well known, but is thought to be minimal. We aimed to determine the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in subgroups of early-onset breast cancer. Germline TP53 mutation status was assessed by DNA sequencing, screening for heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification analyses. From an Australian population-based series of invasive breast cancers, we studied (a) 52 women diagnosed before age 30 years unselected for family history [very early-onset (VEO)] and (b) 42 women diagnosed in their 30s with two or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer [early-onset family history (EO-FH)]. Of the VEO group, two (4%) had a mutation: G13203A (exon 6 missense) in a 24-year-old and a large 5,338-bp genomic deletion in a 26-year-old. Neither had a family cancer history that met Li-Fraumeni criteria. Of the EO-FH group, three (7%) had a mutation: T13240G (a known intron 5 splicing mutation) in a 36-year-old from a classic Li-Fraumeni family; G12299A (exon 4 missense) in a 33-year-old from a Li-Fraumeni-like family; and 14058delG (exon 7 frame-shift) in a 39-year-old with a family cancer history that did not meet Li-Fraumeni criteria. Germline TP53 mutations play a larger role in early-onset breast cancer than previously thought, and in this context, can be evident outside clinically defined Li-Fraumeni families.

Double heterozygosity for germline mutations in BRCA1 and p53 in a woman with early onset breast cancer
To report on a highly unusual case of a 20-year-old woman who presented with multifocal metaplastic breast cancer and was subsequently found to carry deleterious germline mutations in both BRCA1 and p53. Genetic testing was requested on an expedited basis to assist in surgical decision-making and BRCA1/2 and p53 genetic analysis was ordered concurrently. BRCA1/2 and p53 analyses were completed using a combination of direct DNA sequencing and multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA). The patient was found to carry a deletion of exon 3 of the BRCA1 gene and a splice site mutation at the exon4/intron4 boundary of the p53 gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of double heterozygosity in BRCA1 and p53. The patient's clinical presentation is highly reminiscent of that predicted by preclinical mouse models. In patients with early onset breast cancer, the possibility of germline mutations in more than one cancer susceptibility gene should be considered. This could have important clinical implications for patients and their at-risk family members.

Exome sequencing and characterization of 49,960 individuals in the UK Biobank
The UK Biobank is a prospective study of 502,543 individuals, combining extensive phenotypic and genotypic data with streamlined access for researchers around the world1. Here we describe the release of exome-sequence data for the first 49,960 study participants, revealing approximately 4 million coding variants (of which around 98.6% have a frequency of less than 1%). The data include 198,269 autosomal predicted loss-of-function (LOF) variants, a more than 14-fold increase compared to the imputed sequence. Nearly all genes (more than 97%) had at least one carrier with a LOF variant, and most genes (more than 69%) had at least ten carriers with a LOF variant. We illustrate the power of characterizing LOF variants in this population through association analyses across 1,730 phenotypes. In addition to replicating established associations, we found novel LOF variants with large effects on disease traits, including PIEZO1 on varicose veins, COL6A1 on corneal resistance, MEPE on bone density, and IQGAP2 and GMPR on blood cell traits. We further demonstrate the value of exome sequencing by surveying the prevalence of pathogenic variants of clinical importance, and show that 2% of this population has a medically actionable variant. Furthermore, we characterize the penetrance of cancer in carriers of pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. Exome sequences from the first 49,960 participants highlight the promise of genome sequencing in large population-based studies and are now accessible to the scientific community.

Splice-site mutation of the p53 gene in a family with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer
Germline mutations within evolutionary conserved exons of the p53 gene predispose to tumor development in several familial cancer syndromes. We now report identification of a novel p53 mutation affecting the splice acceptor site of exon 6 in the germline DNA of a family with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer. This splice-site mutation, which results in omission of exon 6 and creates a frame-shift and premature stop codon in transcripts from the mutant allele, was found in seven family members--four of whom have developed breast, ovarian or choroid plexus tumors before age 35. Our finding suggests the need to examine the entire p53 gene for splice-site, frame-shift, and nonsense (as well as missense) mutations in families with early-onset hereditary breast and breast-ovarian cancers not linked to the BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17q. We propose that the term 'p53 familial cancer syndrome' be applied to clusters of tumors in families with documented germline p53 mutations, regardless of the histopathologic findings or pattern of tumor development.

Candidate gene analysis of BRCA1/2 mutation-negative high-risk Russian breast cancer patients
Twenty one DNA repair genes were analyzed in a group of 95 BC patients, who displayed clinical features of hereditary disease predisposition but turned out to be negative for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 entire coding region as well as for founder disease-predisposing alleles in CHEK2, NBN/NBS1 and ATM genes. Full-length sequencing of CHEK2 and NBN/NBS1 failed to identify non-founder mutations. The analysis of TP53 revealed a woman carrying the R282W allele; further testing of additional 108 BC patients characterized by a very young age at onset (35 years or earlier) detected one more carrier of the TP53 germ-line defect. In addition, this study confirmed non-random occurrence of PALB2 truncating mutations in Russian hereditary BC patients. None of the studied cases carried germ-line defects in recently discovered hereditary BC genes, BRIP1, FANCC, MRE11A and RAD51C. The analysis of genes with yet unproven BC-predisposing significance (BARD1, BRD7, CHEK1, DDB2, ERCC1, EXO1, FANCG, PARP1, PARP2, RAD51, RNF8, WRN) identified single women carrying a protein-truncating allele, WRN R1406X. DNA sequencing of another set of 95 hereditary BC cases failed to reveal additional WRN heterozygous genotypes. Since WRN is functionally similar to the known BC-predisposing gene, BLM, it deserves to be analyzed in future hereditary BC studies. Furthermore, this investigation revealed a number of rare missense germ-line variants, which are classified as probably protein-damaging by online in silico tools and therefore may require further consideration.

A novel germ line p53 mutation in intron 6 in diverse childhood malignancies
Screening for p53 mutations in exons 5 to 8 in 124 pediatric malignancies identified 18 abnormal shifts using single strand conformation polymorphism: 12 were missense mutations and in 6, no mutation was detected in the exon or in the splice donor acceptor sequences. Sequencing was then performed in the adjacent introns, revealing a G to A base substitution at 39 base pairs upstream to exon 7. This mutation was identified in the germ line of five of the patients, and also in the father of one, whose parents were available. For comparison, of the 184 normal controls similarly screened, only one had this mutation (P=0.036). Positive staining of p53 protein was observed in three of the paraffin embedded tissues that were available: brain tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and lymphocytes from a normal lymph node from the rhabdomyosarcoma patient. All tumors with the identified intron mutation were Li-Fraumeni syndrome tumors. Sequencing of all exons including splice sites was performed and revealed no mutation. We suggest that this mutation in intron 6 of the p53 gene stabilizes the wild type p53 protein, resulting in its abnormal accumulation. Mutations in the noncoding region of p53 should be further studied.

Elevated frequency and functional activity of a specific germ-line p53 intron mutation in familial breast cancer
Previous studies have determined that the frequency of germ-line p53 mutations in familial breast cancer patients is 1% or less, but these reports have not investigated the importance of polymorphic intron base changes in the p53 gene. Therefore, we investigated the frequency of both exon and intron germ-line p53 base changes in 42 breast cancer patients with a strong family history of breast cancer. The mean age of presentation of these patients was 44.0 years (range, 29-69), and 12 of 42 (29%) were of known Ashkenazi ancestry. Purified DNA obtained from the 42 index cases was screened for germ-line p53 mutations in exons 2-11 and surrounding introns using a combination of intron based primers for PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, and microarray sequencing using the Affymetrix p53 gene chip methodology. Morphological analysis of apoptosis and cell survival determination were performed on EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines from two patients with the p53 intron 6 mutation. A germ-line mutation in the p53 gene at nucleotide 13964 with a G to C base change (13964GC) was identified in 3 of 42 (7.1%) hereditary breast cancer patients. Two patients were heterozygous for this mutation, and one patient had a homozygous mutation. In comparison, 0 of 171 (0%) of sporadic breast cancer patients had the p53 13964GC mutation (P = 0.0003). We found that 0 of 42 (0%) of these hereditary breast cancer patients had other germ-line p53 mutation in exons 2-11. However, pedigree analysis demonstrated that all three patients had strong family histories of multiple types of cancers consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome but with late age of onset. Comprehensive BRCA1 and BRCA2 nucleotide analysis from patients with the p53 13964GC mutation revealed no concomitant deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, although they were found in the other hereditary breast cancer patients. Functional analysis of two immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients with the p53 13964GC mutation demonstrated prolonged in vitro survival in response to cisplatinum treatment and showed decreased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Immunohistochemical analysis of breast tumors from these patients revealed high levels of mutant p53 protein, suggesting a functional mutation in the p53 gene. In summary, we have identified a single p53 intron mutation in familial breast cancer patients that is present at elevated frequency and has functional activity.

The benefit and burden of cancer screening in Li-Fraumeni syndrome: a case report
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare cancer predisposition syndrome classically associated with remarkably early onset of cancer in families with a typical spectrum of malignancies, including sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Because the risks of cancer development are strikingly high for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, aggressive cancer surveillance is often pursued in these individuals. However, optimal screening methods and intervals for Li-Fraumeni syndrome have yet to be determined. In addition, there may be a significant psychosocial burden to intensive cancer surveillance and some prevention modalities. Here, we describe a case of a young woman with a de novo mutation in TP53 and multiple malignancies, with her most recent cancers found at early, curable stages due to aggressive cancer screening. The potential benefits and risks of intensive cancer surveillance in hereditary cancer syndromes is discussed.

Multiplex genetic cancer testing identifies pathogenic mutations in TP53 and CDH1 in a patient with bilateral breast and endometrial adenocarcinoma
Background:
        
      
      Germline genetic testing for familial cancer syndromes is usually performed serially for the most likely genetic causes. In recent years the way genetic testing carried out has changed, as next generation sequencing now allows the simultaneous testing of multiple susceptibility genes at low costs.

Synonymous mutation in TP53 results in a cryptic splice site affecting its DNA-binding site in an adolescent with two primary sarcomas
Pathologic variants in TP53 are known risk factors for the development of cancer. We report a 17-year-old male who presented with two primary sarcomas. Germline sequencing revealed a novel TP53 c.672 G>A mutation. Sequencing revealed wild-type TP53 in the parents, and there was no history of cancer in first-degree relatives. This de novo synonymous germline mutation results in a 5' cryptic splice site that is bound by U1, resulting in a shift of the splice site by 5 base pairs. The frame shift results in a truncated protein at residue 246, which disrupts the DNA-binding domain of p53.

Prevalence of germline mutations in the TP53 gene in patients with early-onset breast cancer in the Mexican population
Background:
        
      
      Heterozygous germline TP53 gene mutations result in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS). Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent tumor in young women with LFS. An important issue related to BC in the Mexican population is the average age at diagnosis, which is approximately 11 years younger than that of patients in the United States (U.S.) and Europe. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of germline mutations in TP53 among young Mexican BC patients.

Novel p53 splicing site mutation in Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome with osteosarcoma
We describe a 15-year-old girl with a novel germline p53 splice site mutation who developed an osteosarcoma. She received several cycles of chemotherapy with complete resection of the primary tumor without amputation, and has maintained remission for 18 months. Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome was suspected based on familial history. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a novel germline p53 gene mutation resulting in a G to A transition at position +1 at the donor splice site of intron 6, creating a 6 amino acid insertion. This case provides interesting insight into the phenotype-genotype correlation in LFL syndrome with a TP53 splicing mutation.

Functional studies of a novel germline p53 splicing mutation identified in a patient with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome
Most p53 mutations identified in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) are missense mutations; splicing mutations have rarely been reported. A novel splicing p53 mutation was identified in a patient with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL). Usually, p53 missense mutants identified in LFS and cancer cells function as dominant negative mutations interfering with wild-type p53 function. However, the mechanism by which p53 haploinsufficiency causes carcinogenesis is not well characterized. In this study, we describe a novel splicing mutation that results in the loss-of-function of p53. These findings suggest a linkage between the loss-of-function type p53 mutation and a LFL phenotype.

Inherited germline TP53 mutation encodes a protein with an aberrant C-terminal motif in a case of pediatric adrenocortical tumor
Childhood adrenocortical tumor (ACT), a very rare malignancy, has an annual worldwide incidence of about 0.3 per million children younger than 15 years. The association between inherited germline mutations of the TP53 gene and an increased predisposition to ACT was described in the context of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In fact, about two-thirds of children with ACT have a TP53 mutation. However, less than 10% of pediatric ACT cases occur in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, suggesting that inherited low-penetrance TP53 mutations play an important role in pediatric adrenal cortex tumorigenesis. We identified a novel inherited germline TP53 mutation affecting the acceptor splice site at intron 10 in a child with an ACT and no family history of cancer. The lack of family history of cancer and previous information about the carcinogenic potential of the mutation led us to further characterize it. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the non-natural and highly hydrophobic C-terminal segment of the frame-shifted mutant p53 protein may disrupt its tumor suppressor function by causing misfolding and aggregation. Our findings highlight the clinical and genetic counseling dilemmas that arise when an inherited TP53 mutation is found in a child with ACT without relatives with Li-Fraumeni-component tumors.

Impact of G-quadruplex structures and intronic polymorphisms rs17878362 and rs1642785 on basal and ionizing radiation-induced expression of alternative p53 transcripts
G-quadruplex (G4) structures in intron 3 of the p53 pre-mRNA modulate intron 2 splicing, altering the balance between the fully spliced p53 transcript (FSp53, encoding full-length p53) and an incompletely spliced transcript retaining intron 2 (p53I2 encoding the N-terminally truncated Î40p53 isoform). The nucleotides forming G4s overlap the polymorphism rs17878362 (A1 wild-type allele, A2 16-base pair insertion) which is in linkage disequilibrium with rs1642785 in intron 2 (c.74+38 G>C). Biophysical and biochemical analyses show rs17878362 A2 alleles form similar G4 structures as A1 alleles although their position is shifted with respect to the intron 2 splice acceptor site. In addition basal FSp53 and p53I2 levels showed allele specific differences in both p53-null cells transfected with reporter constructs or lymphoblastoid cell lines. The highest FSp53 and p53I2 levels were associated with combined rs1642785-GG/rs17878362-A1A1 alleles, whereas the presence of rs1642785-C with either rs17878362 allele was associated with lower p53 pre-mRNA, total TP53, FSp53 and p53I2 levels, due to the lower stability of transcripts containing rs1642785-C. Treatment of lymphoblastoid cell with the G4 binding ligands 360A or PhenDC3 or with ionizing radiation increased FSp53 levels only in cells with rs17878362 A1 alleles, suggesting that under this G4 configuration full splicing is favoured. These results demonstrate the complex effects of intronic TP53 polymorphisms on G4 formation and identify a new role for rs1642785 on mRNA splicing and stability, and thus on the differential expression of isoform-specific transcripts of the TP53 gene.

DeltaN133p53 expression levels in relation to haplotypes of the TP53 internal promoter region
The transcription of the DeltaN133p53 isoform of the TP53 gene is controlled by an internal promoter region (IPR) containing eight polymorphisms in 11 common haplotypes, following a resequencing of 47 Caucasians. We assayed the functional effects of the commonest six haplotypes on the promoter activity with a luciferase reporter system, in HeLa and 293T cells. These studies showed that different IPR haplotypes are associated with differences in the promoter activity resulting in marked variation in the baseline expression of DeltaN133p53. In vivo quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on human tissues confirmed that the baseline levels of DeltaN133p53 showed haplotype specific differences that paralleled those seen in vitro. When cell lines were treated with camptothecin, the fold-increase in DeltaN133p53 levels was dose-dependent but haplotype-independent (i.e., similar for all the haplotypes). Finally, we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to analyze the rs1794287 polymorphism and found changes in the pattern of protein binding. This partially confirmed our in silico analysis showing that the polymorphism rs1794287 can affect the function of the internal promoter by changing its affinity for several transcription factors. Thus, we showed that the expression of DeltaN133p53 is under genetic control, and suggested the presence of interindividual differences underlying this mechanism.

A germline variant in the TP53 polyadenylation signal confers cancer susceptibility
To identify new risk variants for cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, we performed a genome-wide association study of 16 million SNPs identified through whole-genome sequencing of 457 Icelanders. We imputed genotypes for 41,675 Illumina SNP chip-typed Icelanders and their relatives. In the discovery phase, the strongest signal came from rs78378222[C] (odds ratio (OR) = 2.36, P = 5.2 Ã 10(-17)), which has a frequency of 0.0192 in the Icelandic population. We then confirmed this association in non-Icelandic samples (OR = 1.75, P = 0.0060; overall OR = 2.16, P = 2.2 Ã 10(-20)). rs78378222 is in the 3' untranslated region of TP53 and changes the AATAAA polyadenylation signal to AATACA, resulting in impaired 3'-end processing of TP53 mRNA. Investigation of other tumor types identified associations of this SNP with prostate cancer (OR = 1.44, P = 2.4 Ã 10(-6)), glioma (OR = 2.35, P = 1.0 Ã 10(-5)) and colorectal adenoma (OR = 1.39, P = 1.6 Ã 10(-4)). However, we observed no effect for breast cancer, a common Li-Fraumeni syndrome tumor (OR = 1.06, P = 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.27).

Rare TP53 genetic variant associated with glioma risk and outcome
Validation of a recent finding linking a rare variant in TP53 to the risk of glioma, the most common primary brain tumour, is reported here. This study genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs78378222 in 566 glioma cases and 603 controls. The variant 'C' allele (with an allelic frequency of 1.1% in controls) was associated with a 3.5-fold excess in glioma risk (odds ratio 3.54; p=0.0001). Variant carriers had significantly improved survival (hazard ratio 0.52; p=0.009) when compared to non-carriers. The rs78378222 SNP is the first confirmed rare susceptibility variant in glioma. Results may shed light on the aetiology and progression of these tumours.

A functional germline variant in the P53 polyadenylation signal and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Aim:
        
      
      P53 plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic stability as well as the control of cell growth and apoptosis. Recently, an uncommon P53 genetic variant (rs78378222) was reported to be significantly associated with multiple cancers in Caucasians in a genome-wide association study. rs78378222 locates in the 3'-untranslated region of the P53 gene, and this A-to-C polymorphism results in changes of the AATAAA polyadenylation signal to AATACA, which leads to impaired 3'-end processing of P53 mRNA and decreased P53 expression.

A novel germline p53 splicing mutation in a pediatric patient with a second malignant neoplasm
A novel germline p53 splicing mutation was identified in a pediatric patient with two metachronous primary cancers that are constituent tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Genomic DNA from the second tumor showed the same mutation and loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus. The mutant mRNA and protein were present in the tumor tissue. In contrast, in the normal tissues bearing the germline mutation in the heterozygous state, predominantly normal mRNA was expressed and the mutant p53 protein was not detectable. The functional silence and relative lack of mutant p53 mRNA expression in the normal tissues of this patient may be caused by decreased stability or decreased production. If this proves a more general pattern of expression of mutant p53 in individuals with germline mutations, these findings may explain the paucity of tumors in individuals affected with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

Report of a bi-allelic truncating germline mutation in TP53
The TP53 gene is fundamental to genomic integrity, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis; it is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. Heterozygous germline mutations cause the autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome, Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. Homozygous germline TP53 mutations in humans are rare. We report an infant from a consanguineous family who presented with synchronous malignancies. Remarkably, he carries a homozygous germline TP53 mutation (NM_000546.4:c.52delA), predicted to cause protein truncation. The family history is consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

A molecular signature of normal breast epithelial and stromal cells from Li-Fraumeni syndrome mutation carriers
Specific changes in gene expression during cancer initiation should enable discovery of biomarkers for risk assessment, early detection and targets for chemoprevention. It has been previously demonstrated that altered mRNA and proteome signatures of morphologically normal cells bearing a single inherited "hit" in a tumor suppressor gene parallel many changes observed in the corresponding sporadic cancer. Here, we report on the global gene expression profile of morphologically normal, cultured primary breast epithelial and stromal cells from Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) TP53 mutation carriers. Our analyses identified multiple changes in gene expression in both morphologically normal breast epithelial and stromal cells associated with TP53 haploinsufficiency, as well as interlocking pathways. Notably, a dysregulated p53 signaling pathway was readily detectable. Pharmacological intervention with the p53 rescue compounds CP-31398 and PRIMA-1 provided further evidence in support of the central role of p53 in affecting these changes in LFS cells and treatment for this cancer. Because loss of signaling mediated by TP53 is associated with the development and survival of many human tumors, identification of gene expression profiles in morphologically normal cells that carry "one-hit" p53 mutations may reveal novel biomarkers, enabling the discovery of potential targets for chemoprevention of sporadic tumors as well.

Whole-exome analysis of a Li-Fraumeni family trio with a novel TP53 PRD mutation and anticipation profile
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous familial cancer predisposition syndrome with autosomal-dominant inheritance caused by heterozygous germline mutations in the TP53 gene. We here analyze the genetic background of a family with a 4-year-proband presented with a Li-Fraumeni tumor. The mother developed breast cancer at age 37 and the proband died at age 8. We performed Sanger sequencing and whole-exome sequencing on peripheral blood DNA from proband and relatives. Data analysis selected only high-quality score and depth reads, rare variants and protein impact involving missense, non-sense, frameshift and splice disrupt mutations. Disease implicated variants and predicted deleterious alterations were also chosen. TP53 genetic testing revealed a never reported TP53 deletion arose as de novo mutation in the mother and inherited by the proband. We then performed whole-exome analysis of the trio to uncover inherited variants from the father that potentially worsen the already altered genetic background in the proband. No pathogenic variants were inherited in autosomal recessive, de novo dominant or X-linked recessive manner. Comparing proband and father exome we detected 25 predicted deleterious variants including a nonsense mutation in ERCC3. Those inherited mutations are possible candidate modifiers linked to TP53, explaining the proband accelerated tumor onset compared to the mother and providing a possible explanation of the genetic anticipation event in this Li-Fraumeni family.

Identification of a novel p53 in-frame deletion in a Li-Fraumeni-like family
We describe a 2-year-old female with a completely resected cerebral pilocytic astrocytoma who subsequently developed B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Her father and paternal uncle were previously diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme. Sequence analysis of the patient's p53 gene revealed a novel germline three base-pair deletion (339_341delCTT) in exon 4, resulting in removal of an evolutionarily conserved phenylalanine amino acid residue at codon 113. The same mutation was found in the patient's two clinically unaffected siblings. The in-frame deletion we describe has not previously been reported and adds to our understanding of the biologic effects of p53 gene mutation in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS).

A novel deletion within exon 6 of TP53 in a family with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome, and LOH in a benign lesion from a mutation carrier
We report here a family with some of the characteristics of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (Li-Fraumeni-like) in which there is a 2 base pair deletion within exon 6 of TP53 in two affected individuals. Of particular interest in this family is a study of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the TP53 gene, and the finding that there is LOH in all cancers available for study from mutation carriers, and additionally from a benign endometrial polyp from one of those patients. Two other family members, one with a rectal carcinoma aged 55, the other with two separate benign lesions under the age of 45, were both wild-type for the TP53 mutation.

The p53 gene in pediatric therapy-related leukemia and myelodysplasia
We investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in 19 pediatric cases of therapy-related leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Eleven children presented with acute myeloid leukemia, one with mixed-lineage leukemia, two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and five with myelodysplasia at times ranging from 11 months to 9 years after a primary cancer diagnosis. The primary cancers, which included 11 solid tumors and eight leukemias, were treated with various combinations of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, alkylating agents, or irradiation. Leukemic or myelodysplastic marrows were screened for possible mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of p53 exons 4 to 8. The only observed mutation was an inherited 2-basepair deletion at codon 209 in exon 6 that would shift the open reading frame, create a premature termination codon, and foreshorten the resultant protein. Prior therapy in this patient included DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, alkylating agents, and irradiation. The secondary leukemia presented as myelodysplasia with monosomies of chromosomes 5 and 7 and abnormalities of chromosome 17. Although the primary cancer was an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and there was a family history of cancer, the case did not fulfill the clinical criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. This study suggests that germline p53 mutations may predispose some children to therapy-related leukemia and myelodysplasia, but that p53 mutations otherwise are infrequent in this setting.

Germline pathogenic variants identified in women with ovarian tumors
Objective:
        
      
      The recognition of genes implicated in ovarian cancer risk beyond BRCA1, BRCA2, and the Lynch syndrome genes has increased the variety of testing options available to providers and patients. We report the frequency of pathogenic variants identified among individuals with ovarian cancer undergoing clinical genetic testing via a multi-gene hereditary cancer panel.

Single base pair germ-line deletion in the p53 gene in a cancer predisposed family
A family with an aggregation of adrenocortical carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and early onset breast cancer was referred to our laboratory. Because this aggregation was reminiscent of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, germ-line mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene was sought in the DNA of two affected members. The highly conserved regions spanning exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were screened by a previously validated denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis method. A single base pair deletion at codon 215 was detected in constitutional DNA of the two patients, and in the DNA extracted from an adrenocortical carcinoma tumor specimen of the propositus. This deletion is predicted to lead to the formation of a truncated p53 protein, a relatively rare event in Li-Fraumeni families. The spectrum of tumors observed in this family does not differ markedly from the spectrum observed in families with missense p53 mutations.

Inherited DNA-Repair Defects in Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer (CRC) heritability has been estimated to be around 30%. However, mutations in the known CRC-susceptibility genes explain CRC risk in fewer than 10% of affected individuals. Germline mutations in DNA-repair genes (DRGs) have recently been reported in CRC, but their contribution to CRC risk is largely unknown. We evaluated the gene-level germline mutation enrichment of 40 DRGs in 680 unselected CRC individuals and 27,728 ancestry-matched cancer-free adults. Significant findings were then examined in independent cohorts of 1,661 unselected CRC individuals and 1,456 individuals with early-onset CRC. Of the 680 individuals in the discovery set, 31 (4.56%) individuals harbored germline pathogenic mutations in known CRC-susceptibility genes, and another 33 (4.85%) individuals had DRG mutations that have not been previously associated with CRC risk. Germline pathogenic mutations in ATM and PALB2 were enriched in both the discovery (OR = 2.81 and p = 0.035 for ATM and OR = 4.91 and p = 0.024 for PALB2) and validation (OR = 2.97 and adjusted p = 0.0013 for ATM and OR = 3.42 and adjusted p = 0.034 for PALB2) sets. Biallelic loss of ATM was evident in all individuals with matched tumor profiling. CRC individuals also had higher rates of actionable mutations in the HR pathway, which can substantially increase the risk of developing cancers other than CRC. Our analysis provides evidence for ATM and PALB2 as CRC-risk genes, underscoring the importance of the homologous recombination pathway in CRC. In addition, we identified frequent complete homologous recombination deficiency in CRC tumors, representing a unique opportunity to explore targeted therapeutic interventions such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi).

Malignant triton tumor in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and a novel TP53 mutation
We report a 3-year-old boy with a malignant triton tumor (MTT) involving the left masticator space with local invasion and regional lymph node metastasis. Family history and detection of a novel germline TP53 mutation confirmed his diagnosis of Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). MTT has not been previously described in association with LFS. This case along with a comprehensive review of the literature, illustrate the importance of both somatic and germline TP53 mutations in the pathogenesis MTT. The tumor could not be resected and he was successfully treated with intensive induction chemotherapy, irradiation, and high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation.

Drastic effect of germline TP53 missense mutations in Li-Fraumeni patients
In contrast to other tumor suppressor genes, the majority of TP53 alterations are missense mutations. We have previously reported that in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), germline TP53 missense mutations are associated with an earlier age of tumor onset. In a larger series, we observed that mean age of tumor onset in patients harboring dominant negative missense mutations and clearly null mutations was 22.6 and 37.5 years, respectively. To assess the impact of heterozygous germline TP53 mutations in the genetic context of the patients, we developed a new functional assay of the p53 pathway on the basis of induction of DNA damage in Epstein-Barr-virus-immortalized lymphocytes, followed by comparative gene-expression profiling. In wild-type lymphocytes, we identified a core of 173 genes whose expression was induced more than twofold, of which 46 were known p53 target genes. In LFS lymphocytes with canonical missense mutations, the number of induced genes and the level of known p53 target genes induction were strongly reduced as compared with controls and LFS lymphocytes with null mutations. These results show that certain germline missense TP53 mutations, such as those with dominant negative effect, dramatically alter the response to DNA damage. This probably explains why TP53 alterations are predominantly missense mutations.

Familial brain tumour syndrome associated with a p53 germline deletion of codon 236
This report describes clinical, neuropathological and molecular genetic findings in a Swiss family with four brain tumours in only two generations. The neoplasms observed covered a wide range of biologic behaviour, from a slowly growing lesion already apparent at birth, to anaplastic astrocytoma in a young adult and glioblastomas at the age of less than 10 years. The only non-neural neoplasms in this family were a case of leukemia and an adrenocortical carcinoma. A germline deletion of codon 236 of the p53 tumour suppressor gene was identified as an underlying cause and detected in all affected family members. This mutation has not previously been reported as germline transmission or in sporadic tumours. The unusual accumulation of CNS tumours may be due to a certain organ-specific effect of this particular p53 mutation or it may reflect the specific genetic back-ground of this family.

A novel TP53 germ-line mutation identified in a girl with a primitive neuroectodermal tumor and her father
A search of TP53 mutations was undertaken in a series of 51 pediatric brain tumors. The only germ-line mutation was detected in a 9-year-old girl with a PNET. Her family history was unremarkable for neoplastic disease, except for the paternal grandfather, who died of a gallbladder carcinoma at an advanced age. The mutation was a thymine deletion at the first base of codon 241, leading to termination codon at position 246 that has not previously been reported. This mutation was found to be inherited from the proband's father, who was healthy at age 40. In the tumoral sample, loss of heterozygosity in several 17p markers was found, the only TP53 allele preserved in the tumor was the mutated one. The presence of two short tandem repeats and two different palindromic sequences spanning the deletion lead us to propose the predisposition of this region to forming a complex secondary structure during replication. Consequently, it could have facilitated the present deletion. Furthermore, six other short deletions affecting--partially or totally--the region implicated in the folding model that we propose have been described in the literature. These findings confirm that this sequence represents a hotspot of deletion in the TP53 gene.
